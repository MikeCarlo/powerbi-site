here's the skills an agent would need to know to use all best practices. And I thought to myself, this is exactly what architects should be doing. The reason you have an architect on your team is to sit down and say, I know the best way to build pro programming in code because of all my years of experience. When I do code reviews, I don't actually write the code. I'm just going to review what everyone else wrote. Hey, you're using a null pointer or whatever over here or you're doing this function that's irrelevant. Hey, you're using a data type of any. We don't like that. That's not what we do here, right? So it's able to pick up and so this is one of the reasons why agents are so helpful is you can give it the instructions and it understands how to read the code at volume and within minutes you're getting a code review as opposed to hours of someone else actually physically looking at it and they may not even catch everything. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So to me, this this whole skills area is like really interesting &gt;&gt; and I'm taking some lessons learned from, you know, um, Open Claw and trying to incorporate that into like how I actually use agents today.
