It was ridiculous. I I just couldn't believe it. And it was because it was written assembly, but nobody takes the time &gt;&gt; to do it. So, if we get to that point, which I think we will, that'll be amazing because now, yeah, we just talk to LM just like you and I. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; They build the stuff, but they build it much better. So, that means data centers, much less usage, etc., etc. So, there's a lot of things downstream &gt;&gt; and and I think this is this is the lynch pin for me, right? A lot of this is like I had this epiphany today. I'm like, "Oh my goodness, we're done." Like like it's not that we're done programming. It's that we're done building things. We're done in any way. None of that is going away. What we've just hit is we've just hit a massive unlock on hyperefficiency on app building and we talk to it in our language and the compiler now is now the large language models.
