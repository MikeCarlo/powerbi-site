## Transcript

Uh, welcome to our live stream. We're going to try this out here. Just trying a new format. No intro video yet. Uh, we don't have any kind of intro song. We're trying a portrait mode &gt;&gt; uh landscape here a little bit. And um, this is wigging me out here because I it's switched around. I can't see Arondo on my screen. So, I'm going to switch around here on the screens a little bit. We're going to try this this format here. Um, for those of you who are following me on PowerBI tips, I want to introduce you to we've seen Arando on the show a couple times before. Arando is here. He and I are doing some side pro projects around data and moving data around and doing some things. We are here to discuss a little about this clawbot, maltbot, open clawbot, like what all the bots are. It's literally the same project. I'm so confused. Uh but I I have some initial reactions. Armando, I got to say publicly, thank you so much for introducing to Miss to me to this whole environment that we're getting into. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's okay. You're I'm [laughter] sorry. Exactly right. Maybe give a little bit of background, Armando. Why are we talking about this now? And what did you do? What what project did we start noodling on here? And and we're just kind of we're figuring this out as we go. We just hit an unlock and we want to share it. Armano, give us a story. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. Yeah. Well, I was talking about this this morning. It's the whole like LLMs come into the picture. Now we want to use them for coding. Now we want them to do a little bit more. And then it's like but every session is its own thing and sometimes I want it to do more things and just keep talking to it and have it remember things and having it in your computer is sometimes impractical because you're on the road and etc. We're always moving around. &gt;&gt; So then comes along this project called Clawbot. Then it then changed name to Moldbot and now it's called Open Claw &gt;&gt; since last night. And they they basically wrap your favorite flavor in this case Anthropics uh Opus 4.5 in like a Telegram or WhatsApp or Slack, Google chat, whatever interface. So now you can talk to it from wherever you are on your phone or computer and it's really neat. Just that makes it very practical. But I think what really makes it exciting is that it's actually running not the chat version that you use in the app but the terminal CLI version. So for those who are not very technical that means like cloud code or openAI's codeex that means it has access to the file system and it can create files download apps generate apps test apps run whole environments and you are just talking to it via telegram. This is insane. So that's what this thing is. But I there's a huge wave of people showing up and doing things. So I think the mental model I lose here a little bit is like you you typically talk to like a chat session. You have like a prompt a window and eventually the thing just gets junked up and and messy. What I'm learning from this project and I I I literally implemented last night. I had some work I had to get done. I had to do some this is for the PowerBI people on the on the channel. This is a semantic model I was playing with. I'm using an MCP server for PowerBI desktop. So PowerBI desktop comes on your machine. I can MCP my way into the server and um the the MCP talks to the PowerBI desktop and I'm able to command it to do different things. Uh hey, make a measure, add some folders, any column that is a number, hide it and add a measure that does a sum on top of that column. So really neat things, super powerful. But then I had this epiphany. Uh Armando thankfully had a couple days before showed me this um at the time we installed Claudebot. Since it's installed, it has now changed to maltbot and now currently it is now OpenClaw as the the name of the system or the infrastructure. But at the time we were talking to Clawbot and and his name was Alfred. So Armando, you interviewed him. He gave you some information like what do you want me to call you? All these kind of things. And there was a learning for me that okay, I've given a large language model full control of a machine. And you'll see a lot of people right now going out and I'm buying a Mac Mini. I'm buying this computer. I'm putting these things together. And the reason they're doing this is because they don't want it to be on their main machine and they want to treat it like a different employee. And I had an epiphany as we were doing this. I'm thinking this is more like an employee than it is like an agent on your computer. Normally, I would prompt it and it would give me just text back and there's all these security restrictions. It can't edit my files. It can't do things on my machine. If I hired a new employee, I would not let them see my machine. I would not let them access it unless on very specific things. I wouldn't trust them for that. &gt;&gt; In in the same way, I would set them up a user identity. I would set them up, you know, if you need to access my SharePoint site, you can access it using this specific identity and you can just pop that into um you know their knowledge base. And so what I was learning from this is as I'm I'm working with Armono on Claudebot here and this stuff is it's making its own instructions. It's saving its own passwords. It's behaving just like an employee. And because the memory of the agent is limited, all it's doing is writing a whole bunch of markdown files and referencing them in a folder structure. And so when you ask it to, hey Claudebot, or hey whatever, I want you to go connect to the semantic model. I want you to go download this program. I want you to do XYZ things, it makes its own skills essentially and writes them back down and then goes to pick them up when they need them. Is that a good kind of a assumption Armando of like how you were seeing it work? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, one of the great things about it and hey Mike and Brianna I see some messages coming in. The cool thing about it is when you're using cloud code which is supremely powerful on its own. You have it on your computer. You installed it. You're developing right? it can write or you can tell it to write into a cloud.md a markdown file what that project is about what that repository is about and just keep track of what it's doing so next so you can interact with it across session it sort of remembers and it's very good now what cloudbot modebot openclaw does is it has its own separate files that it keeps sort of long term so it could be context switching and you could be talking to it and has the like the soul [laughter] &gt;&gt; file personality And that one stays. &gt;&gt; That's hilarious. &gt;&gt; And I think that's what it's called literally. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. It's called the soul soul.md, right? &gt;&gt; Soul.md. [laughter] And then and then the other files might be more project based. And so it's cool because you could be talking to it and it keeps its personality, but then if you reference project A, it'll know what project A is about. If you reference project B, it knows, right? And so you were saying it it sort of keeps tabs on that. And then it also keeps tabs on all those skills you were talking about like oh I know how to MCP into superbase I know how to MCP into N8N I know how to talk to fabric right &gt;&gt; and all those don't have to be in the full context of a huge conversation he can actually clear context with the LLM itself but have its own context that it loads in each conversation to keep track of everything &gt;&gt; sort of yeah &gt;&gt; yes so and and I I like that the way you you described that. So that's a like that's the part, but it acts this clawed bot that this open call solution really is now very different in how I observe like um not very different. It's almost the same obser observations as when I'm hiring new employees. Same kind of concept. And and that's kind of how I'm treating it there on my side is I'm looking at this person being, okay, you're a brand new employee. I'm bringing you on board. Let's let's see how you work in concert with my team or whatever. So all this to say I'm learning this with Armando. I'm now on my own building the PowerBI MCP. I'm building things over there and I decide I have a I have some data I need. I have documentation on a website HTML page &gt;&gt; and it describes column names. It describes information. It and then I have a PowerBI report that is the same tables, but there's no documentation. I'm missing all my descriptions. So, I use the PowerBI MCP, get the HTML page, suck down all the information that I needed from just like a web, just a literally an interactive, you know, schema diagram. &gt;&gt; I said, read this code. &gt;&gt; Find me the table name that matches over here that it does in my semantic model. And oh, by the way, this HTML page has all this web documentation about like descriptions and what it so I literally just showed up told it here's the source of information here's my semantic model match up the tables go summarize the columns and column descriptions that you find in this other language which had a bunch of SQL statements and had a bunch of other it can just figure it out it summarized all of my columns and then it built my documentation for a single table and it added all my measures on the columns Um, I was able to make uh see there were measures and actually build them into my semantic model. Already done, easy to do. And so I I thought for a moment I was like, "Oh, I'm going to pull on my Claudebot knowledge here." And I'm going to say, "Okay, now that I've done a single task, &gt;&gt; I told the agent and I think I think I was talking to Claude in my VS Code instance at this time. I said, make a skill &gt;&gt; that does this." And so in doing that, in making the skill around this agent that I can then pull forward was great because now I can pull that agent in, I saved the skill into my little folder. And then I said, "Okay, great. Clear the context window, start it over again, and I said, let's go from ground zero." Told it, go use the skill that you just made for yourself and do this for every table in the database or in in my semantic model. And it went through and it ripped through 190 columns making its own descriptions doing the and I even went through and said you know what I don't really like the descriptions you made for the ID columns because it's a key and surrogate key make a better description and actually if there's any IDs like what tables is it used in &gt;&gt; and write out hey this ID column links to these other two tables I need to get this stuff together like just build a better description. Oh, I know what you're talking about. And it just goes out and does it. And so now I've And then know, okay, update your instructions on your skills to do this for any kind of ID columns. So I'm looking at this going, I just wrote programming code. Like I I just wrote a function just called a skill, &gt;&gt; but I didn't do any of it. I just literally worked with it on the process, figured it out, told it to document its own process, store it away, and then just reuse its own process. My mind was blowing up. I'm like, this I saved myself days of work. In two hours, I had documented this model to a very high degree with lots of changes very rapidly. And all I did was program it with talking to the model. And then I have another point around this one, but Armando, what do you think? No, I think you're on point. And some people mentioned my volume was low. I erased it a little. Tell me if that that helps. But &gt;&gt; I adjusted on my end too a little bit. &gt;&gt; The this the talking to it and giving it your instructions. We were talking about this the other day. Yes. People say like, "No, but you have to learn programming otherwise you don't know like what's what's going on." But at the end of the day, just think about it. Programming is just like &gt;&gt; Yeah. JavaScript, C++, C assembly, like whatever programming language exists since the beginning of computers, those were created such that we could talk with the computer because there was no other way like unless we wanted to like skip right and do jumps and stuff. Now, &gt;&gt; if you wanted to tell it what to do, then you would use a programming language and they were they're not English by any means. they were just a way to talk with the computer. So now what what that did was enable a lot of developers to eventually create applications. But now we're in a point where it understands us natural language and it understands code. So if you tell it clearly what you want it to do, it will just convert that into very very good code. So it doesn't make messy code. Some people think it makes no it makes very good code. It just will create whatever code it understood you to want. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's the point. So again, my ex having better um skills, having better instructions, having better those things are incredibly important now because that's going to dictate like what are your coding best practice. So I found another one. I found a a whole cloud skills repo somewhere. I have to go dig it up somewhere. I found a whole Big Cloud skills repo of here's every single different language, &gt;&gt; JavaScript, React, all the different languages. Here's the skills an agent would need to know to use all best practices. And I thought to myself, this is exactly what architects should be doing. The reason you have an architect on your team is to sit down and say, I know the best way to build pro programming and code because of all my years of experience. When I do code reviews, I don't actually write the code. I'm just going to review what everyone else wrote. Hey, you're using a null pointer or whatever over here or you're doing this function that's irre irrelevant. Hey, you're using a data type of any. We don't like that. That's not what we do here, right? So, it's able to pick up and so this is one of the reasons why agents are so helpful is you can give it the instructions and it understands how to read the code at volume and within minutes you're getting a code review as opposed to hours of someone else actually physically looking at it and they may not even catch everything. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So to me, this this whole skills area is like really interesting &gt;&gt; and I'm taking some lessons learned from, you know, um, Open Claw and trying to incorporate that into like how I actually use agents today and and I don't I feel like right now everything I do is start in a folder. Like I go to I go to VS Code, I make a folder somewhere on my machine and I start there. like I have to have a folder to begin with because I'm going to tell it to make files. I'm gonna tell it to document itself. And I'm now looking at how do I take that knowledge and better distribute that to the rest of my team. like that that's that's going to be super impactful now long term is because I'm able to work with an agent build patterns document them and then now that the trick is how do I distribute my skills that we've developed &gt;&gt; or my engineers are developing amongst the team and that's another whole kind of another ball of wax but this is so amazing and I I want to double down on your point Arando you said we don't really know what code it's writing and or we're getting less and less of that as we go along. I want to introduce another concept here. I'm going to predict this and and this is maybe already happened to some degree. I have not seen it on my newsfeed, but whatever for whatever reason, whenever Armando and I make predictions now, we're just making predictions based on what we see coming down the road from a technology standpoint. And and it literally it within weeks now, it's literally showing up in my newsfeed of like, hey, someone made this thing. So, here's my next prediction for you. My next prediction is someone is going to invent or we're going to build languages that humans cannot read in programming. Now my argument here is already I don't get a JSON file and I don't tell the computer put it on this registry on my disc. I I do not do that. Right? That's already been abstracted so far away from that. I could never write that code even if you'd maybe try. I don't have the knowledge. I can't write machine level code on things. just don't do it right. So at what point in time, so when I look at like TypeScript, Python, React, all these frameworks that are there, the only reason the framework exists is to help humans, people understand loops and structures and frames and objects. And it's it's bridging the gap between me as a person and what I can understand. And it's simplifying a lot of what's happening down the computer level. So it's literally just an we call this abstraction abstraction layer upon abstraction layer like I have an op I have the binary code that's running then I have the the operating system and then I have you know the program or the Figma or the browser like all these things are abstractions away from something that's really there. Okay, let's just skip all that and let's just say hey agent you need to build your own programming language. We don't care to read what it is, but as part of your programming language, I'm going to tell you to build things, websites, whatever, whatever, whatever. You design what you feel like you need, and I'm just going to tell you what I want, and you're going to figure it out. Right? You just design, and I don't need to read it. I'm not going to review your code. We're getting to the point. We've we've hit, I think, my opinion, we've hit the last programming language you'll ever need. We're done. and the programming language is your native tongue or English because I speak that or you know Portuguese or whatever whatever language you're speaking that is the end of the that's that is the end game. If you can get to that level and talk to a computer with whatever you understand &gt;&gt; we're done. &gt;&gt; There's not another needed abstraction layer of language. We've hit the end. So I think the prediction here is we've landed at the final programming language that we need and now what's going to happen is we're going to just continue to talk to the computers and from there we're going to remove all abstracted layers of code and programming. It's going to be gone in like a year, two years, five years. We're not far away from this, I don't think. So what do you think? What's this prediction? Are we all &gt;&gt; I agree? Yes. I I I think I read it in a paper somewhere that that some some like weird educational academic level thing was happening &gt;&gt; um experimental setting. But yes, I completely agree and Mike Fton was also saying like why would two agents think that human languages are the best way to communicate amongst themselves, right? Which is perfectly true. It's a good example. &gt;&gt; I've seen that one before, &gt;&gt; right? It's like no, they'll just communicate in whatever they need and it'll be a lot less to transfer over the wire which will make it a lot faster, a lot faster to process. And what's very funny was I was laughing when you were saying it all these like people don't know this but or many people don't know this but languages right are they started like an assembly right and then you get to see and then you have like operating systems and then on top of that you might have a few others but then some of these have virtual machines like Java had its virtual machine right and then you have like typescript and all that and this is running in the browser which is on top of its own layer and so &gt;&gt; then people started like oh but then we have Wasum which like compiles to assembly so it sort of brings it down and makes it faster. And I think what's going to happen is we went so high up to make it easy to program &gt;&gt; and like you were saying it's going to get to a point where now &gt;&gt; it's going to start going down again &gt;&gt; and so the LLM will start to talk in the lowest possible abstraction layer and it'll become the apps will be much more efficient, the memory use will be much more efficient. You remove like the gigs of trash. &gt;&gt; Don't need it &gt;&gt; underneath the app. &gt;&gt; I I remember this. I know. &gt;&gt; You're going to build kilobyte. You're going to build like you're going to build like kilobyte level apps &gt;&gt; because it's all written in the lowest language. Zero abstraction anywhere. &gt;&gt; Exactly. There was this studio I went to a very long time ago, a recording studio. And they had this weird software I had never seen. They weren't using uh ProTools or Cubase or Newendo or anything like that. They were using this other thing. Turns out it was built in assembly and like this whole software DAW was built in assembly. So it could run in a very low power computer and you would turn on plugins like crazy SSL plugins and you know how there's this little glitch that when you turn on a plugin it's processing it's you don't do it with live audio. You don't turn on and off, right? you could do that. It would just be transparent as if you were just doing it in in a in an analog thing. And the whole DAW was like 2 megs or something. It was ridiculous. I I just couldn't believe it. And it was because it was written assembly, but nobody takes the time &gt;&gt; to do it. So, if we get to that point, which I think we will, that'll be amazing because now Yeah. We just talked to LMS just like you and I. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; They build the stuff, but they build it much better. So that means data centers much less usage etc etc. So there's a lot of things downstream &gt;&gt; and and I think this is this is the lynch pin for me, right? A lot of this is like I had this epiphany today. I'm like, "Oh my goodness. We're done." Like like it's not that we're done programming. It's that we're done building things and we're done. And anyway, none of that is going away. What we've just hit is we've just hit a massive unlock on hyper efficiency on app building and we talk to it in our language and the compiler now is now large language models. the lang the large rang language models will build it and so someone just needs to come up with so who knows what it is will be I don't know how long it's going to take but we're in we're in the next couple of months someone is going to produce another earthshaking programming languages that has nothing to do with people uh and everyone just is going to focus on building these abstracted layers down to machine code and so that's what you're going to be building I don't know how you'll test it I don't know how you'll know if it's right. I don't know how if you'll know if it's like mining Bitcoin at the same time of doing all these other things. I don't know. I just don't know what the agent's going to do. So, at some point, you're going to have to figure out there's a there's a whole ethical problem that we're going to eventually run into here, like what this means. How is this going to work? But I foresee this coming to a place where we're going to get to a place where all the abstraction layers that we have tra traditionally been using are going to be removed from us. And the same way I don't tell my computer where to put this data on the disk, &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not going to care. I'm just going to talk to it and get everything just get everything working there. So, yeah. So, Mike Forbin, I appreciate it. Um, yeah, you heard it here first. Armando and I had to unpack this idea together with our community. We hope you enjoy this idea. This is very, very forward thinking. Maybe or not. I don't know. I know. Now that we've said it and it's actually out on the internet, someone's probably going to go take it and run with it. Or if we if we have someone out there who's already doing this, we'd love to talk to you, bring you on the show. We we'd love to unpack. Is this a real thing? And maybe there's challenges that we're not seeing &gt;&gt; that could be done here in a near period of time. I don't know. &gt;&gt; I think it it'll it'll happen. And the fact that we don't know what the operating system is doing. Like that's that's one of the things that I really like. I didn't like the class per se. I'm sorry. But when I we had there was one class in college where they asked us to build &gt;&gt; a little operating system, right? Yep. And &gt;&gt; and you had to talk about registers and memory and like a bunch of other stuff. And if you &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; learn about that stuff, it's like, wow, all this happens behind the scenes. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; So it's very interesting, but it's been abstracted so long ago that we have no idea what happens. So your computer might be like doing &gt;&gt; loops and stuff that you have no idea storing stuff here and there and moving it and back and forth and like &gt;&gt; it's but as long as you can test because nowadays we're more in the application layer for most everything. And so in that regard as long as you can have the thing run its tests and make sure that it's doing what it should in a repeatable fashion etc. and that there's the semi discreet things happening um then great remember we're not so far from quantum computing at which point all goes out the window regarding if whether it was A or B now it's just like the whole quantum realm it's like it's just crazy stuff you don't know what's happening so at that point it won't matter that you want to keep track of what's going on there won't be a know what's going on as long as it works That's as far as you go. &gt;&gt; I would I would maybe even argue to this point as well like that's just another like it's another technology, right? Someone's going to write someone's going to need to write um you know BIOS for you know quantum computing. Someone's going to need to write all that and we may have already met the point. We've already we may have already hit the moment in time where you're no longer going to need to do that anymore. Someone's not going to need to write that. You're just going to tell the parameters of what it needs to get done to the agent and the agents or team of agents. Now I mean again I'm also looking at this um again my example back to the semantic model rebuilding thing right two main arguments I had almost my entire career which has been if I had enough time and I had enough money I could build a perfect product right what agents has done for me it has collapsed to both of those at the same time and this is another big thought here right agents are collapsing the entire entirey of time into from what took days down to minutes. That's a huge collapse. Okay. As soon as you reduce time, you immediately reduce spend on how long it takes you to get anything done. So, that's another major concept. And then on top of that, I'm switching out my time and saving a lot of money on that end to spend what, $200 a month on a Claude Max subscription. &gt;&gt; Yeah. pays for itself in the first day you have it. Not even the first hour of this. There's people that get are billing. You do a talk to a lawyer, their bill rates are like $450 to $1,500 per hour. One clawed code subscription pays for like 15 minutes of their time and you can now use that the entire month and you've got and I think this is another another concept here I think is just so impactful here is you have to understand that the agents and the large language models, the composite are building these things. You you listen to grock you listen to they are trying to encompass all of human knowledge into a computer everything it know there isn't a single programming lang programming language that I know better than any large language model all of them are 100% better than I am in everything everything think about that you I can't bring anything to the table to any large language model so what I have to do in order for me to stay competitive in my space I have to learn how to leverage the tools. I've got to be a problem solver. I've got to move away from doing the task and I've got to move into orchestrating and building the solutions. So, if anything, I'm going to land it on that one. Very exciting future. There's a lot of things coming. We hope you like this format. Please let us know in the comments. Do you like this format? Is the is the long tong tall format here working for you? Do you like it? Um let us know on the social media platforms. Uh we really do appreciate your listenership uh with this kind of talks. We'll hopefully do more of these. So, Armando, thank you so much. Any final thoughts? &gt;&gt; No, I I think you're on point. And if every anyone's trying to decipher whether they should use something like this, just try it. Like Mike was saying, don't go buy a Mac Mini, right? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; If you want to experiment, no. Grab like I have a 2012 MacBook Pro right there. Yep. &gt;&gt; Sitting there collecting dust. That's where I installed it. &gt;&gt; I got one, too. I got an old Razor that's a couple years old. I'm going to just put it up on it and just go. We're just going to do it &gt;&gt; and and play with it, right? It's uh as long as you don't give it access to any important stuff, there's no real risk. &gt;&gt; Treat it like an employee. Give it an employee. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's got its own credentials. You give access to it as if it has an identity just like everything else. &gt;&gt; Treat it like an employee. It's just like another employee that you have. You're not going to give it your credentials to your things, to your calendars, those things. That's not the right way to do this. So, if anything, I've learned that do it in a secure way. Um there's a lot of people already starting to talk about the security risks of all this. Yes. Treat it like an employee. Just give it. its own credentials when you make things. So anyways, that being said, thank you so much, Armando. We'll see you next time. Thank you for this very short episode. Talk to you later. Thanks, Mike. Cheers. Cheers.
