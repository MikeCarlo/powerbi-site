We're getting to the point. We've we've hit I think my opinion we've hit the last programming language you'll ever need. We're done. And the programming language is your native tongue or English because I speak that or you know Portuguese or whatever whatever language you're speaking that is the end of the that's that is the end game. If you can get to that level and talk to a computer with whatever you understand, &gt;&gt; we're done. &gt;&gt; There's not another needed abstraction layer of language. We've hit the end. So I think the prediction here is we've landed at the final programming language that we need. And now what's going to happen is we're going to just continue to talk to the computers. And from there we're going to remove all abstracted layers of code and programming. It's going to be gone in like a year, two years, five years. We're not far away from this, I don't think. So, what do you think?
