we're going to eventually run into here like what this means. How is this going to work? But I foresee this coming to a place where we're going to get to a place where all the abstraction layers that we have tra traditionally been using are going to be removed from us. And the same way I don't tell my computer where to put this data on the disk. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to care. I'm just going to talk to it and get everything just get everything working there. So yeah. So Mike Forbin, I appreciate it. Um yeah, you heard it here first. Armando and I had to unpack this idea together with our community. We hope you enjoy this idea. This is very very forward thinking maybe or not. I don't know. You know, now that we've said it and it's actually out on the internet, someone's probably going to go take it and run with it. Or if we if we have someone out there who's already doing this, we'd love to talk to you, bring you on the show. We we'd love to unpack is this a real thing? And maybe there's challenges that we're not seeing &gt;&gt; that could be done here in a near period of time. I don't know.
