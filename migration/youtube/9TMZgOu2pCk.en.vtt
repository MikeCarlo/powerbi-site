programming code. Like I I just wrote a
 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.190 align:start position:0%
programming code. Like I I just wrote a
function,<00:00:07.520><c> just</c><00:00:07.759><c> called</c><00:00:07.919><c> a</c><00:00:08.160><c> skill,</c>

&gt;&gt; but I didn't do any of it. I just
 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.430 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; but I didn't do any of it. I just
literally<00:00:10.960><c> worked</c><00:00:11.200><c> with</c><00:00:11.440><c> it</c><00:00:11.599><c> on</c><00:00:11.840><c> the</c><00:00:12.000><c> process,</c>

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
literally worked with it on the process,
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.470 align:start position:0%
literally worked with it on the process,
figured<00:00:13.759><c> it</c><00:00:13.920><c> out,</c><00:00:15.040><c> told</c><00:00:15.280><c> it</c><00:00:15.440><c> to</c><00:00:15.839><c> document</c><00:00:16.240><c> its</c>

figured it out, told it to document its
 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.630 align:start position:0%
figured it out, told it to document its

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
own process, store it away, and then
 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.109 align:start position:0%
own process, store it away, and then
just<00:00:18.800><c> reuse</c><00:00:19.039><c> its</c><00:00:19.279><c> own</c><00:00:19.439><c> process.</c><00:00:20.240><c> My</c><00:00:20.560><c> mind</c><00:00:20.800><c> was</c>

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
just reuse its own process. My mind was
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.269 align:start position:0%
just reuse its own process. My mind was
blowing<00:00:21.439><c> up.</c><00:00:21.680><c> I'm</c><00:00:21.840><c> like,</c><00:00:22.080><c> this</c><00:00:22.800><c> I</c><00:00:23.039><c> saved</c>

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
blowing up. I'm like, this I saved
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.870 align:start position:0%
blowing up. I'm like, this I saved

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
myself days of work. In two hours, I had
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.790 align:start position:0%
myself days of work. In two hours, I had
documented<00:00:27.359><c> this</c><00:00:27.519><c> model</c><00:00:27.760><c> to</c><00:00:28.000><c> a</c><00:00:28.240><c> very</c><00:00:28.560><c> high</c>

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
documented this model to a very high
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.710 align:start position:0%
documented this model to a very high
degree<00:00:29.119><c> with</c><00:00:29.439><c> lots</c><00:00:29.679><c> of</c><00:00:29.840><c> changes</c><00:00:30.400><c> very</c>

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
