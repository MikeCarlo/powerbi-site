00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
I think the prediction here is we've
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.709 align:start position:0%
I think the prediction here is we've
landed<00:00:32.880><c> at</c><00:00:33.200><c> the</c><00:00:33.520><c> final</c><00:00:33.920><c> programming</c><00:00:34.399><c> language</c>

landed at the final programming language
that<00:00:34.960><c> we</c><00:00:35.120><c> need.</c><00:00:35.840><c> And</c><00:00:36.000><c> now</c><00:00:36.160><c> what's</c><00:00:36.480><c> going</c><00:00:36.559><c> to</c>

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
that we need. And now what's going to
 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.229 align:start position:0%
that we need. And now what's going to
happen<00:00:36.880><c> is</c><00:00:37.200><c> we're</c><00:00:37.440><c> going</c><00:00:37.520><c> to</c><00:00:37.680><c> just</c><00:00:37.920><c> continue</c>

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
happen is we're going to just continue
 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
happen is we're going to just continue
to<00:00:38.559><c> talk</c><00:00:38.800><c> to</c><00:00:38.960><c> the</c><00:00:39.200><c> computers.</c><00:00:40.079><c> And</c><00:00:40.320><c> from</c><00:00:40.559><c> there</c>

to talk to the computers. And from there
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 align:start position:0%
to talk to the computers. And from there
we're<00:00:41.520><c> going</c><00:00:41.600><c> to</c><00:00:41.760><c> remove</c><00:00:42.239><c> all</c><00:00:42.640><c> abstracted</c>

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
