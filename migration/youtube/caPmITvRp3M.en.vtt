It<00:00:00.240><c> was</c><00:00:01.199><c> ridiculous.</c><00:00:01.839><c> I</c><00:00:01.920><c> I</c><00:00:02.240><c> just</c><00:00:02.320><c> couldn't</c>

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
It was ridiculous. I I just couldn't
 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.830 align:start position:0%
It was ridiculous. I I just couldn't
believe<00:00:02.720><c> it.</c><00:00:02.879><c> And</c><00:00:03.040><c> it</c><00:00:03.120><c> was</c><00:00:03.280><c> because</c><00:00:03.439><c> it</c><00:00:03.600><c> was</c>

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
believe it. And it was because it was
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.269 align:start position:0%
believe it. And it was because it was
written<00:00:04.160><c> assembly,</c><00:00:04.480><c> but</c><00:00:04.640><c> nobody</c><00:00:04.880><c> takes</c><00:00:05.040><c> the</c>

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
written assembly, but nobody takes the
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.309 align:start position:0%
written assembly, but nobody takes the
time

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
time
 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.710 align:start position:0%
time
&gt;&gt; to<00:00:06.560><c> do</c><00:00:06.720><c> it.</c><00:00:07.120><c> So,</c><00:00:07.359><c> if</c><00:00:07.520><c> we</c><00:00:07.680><c> get</c><00:00:07.839><c> to</c><00:00:08.000><c> that</c><00:00:08.320><c> point,</c>

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; to do it. So, if we get to that point,
 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.030 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; to do it. So, if we get to that point,
which<00:00:08.960><c> I</c><00:00:09.280><c> think</c><00:00:09.440><c> we</c><00:00:09.679><c> will,</c><00:00:10.480><c> that'll</c><00:00:10.880><c> be</c>

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
which I think we will, that'll be
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.629 align:start position:0%
which I think we will, that'll be
amazing<00:00:11.360><c> because</c><00:00:11.599><c> now,</c><00:00:11.840><c> yeah,</c><00:00:12.080><c> we</c><00:00:12.320><c> just</c><00:00:12.480><c> talk</c>

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
amazing because now, yeah, we just talk
 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.709 align:start position:0%
amazing because now, yeah, we just talk
to<00:00:12.880><c> LM</c><00:00:13.440><c> just</c><00:00:13.599><c> like</c><00:00:13.840><c> you</c><00:00:14.000><c> and</c><00:00:14.240><c> I.</c>

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
to LM just like you and I.
 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:15.270 align:start position:0%
to LM just like you and I.
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yep.
 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.910 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; They<00:00:15.519><c> build</c><00:00:15.839><c> the</c><00:00:16.160><c> stuff,</c><00:00:16.800><c> but</c><00:00:17.119><c> they</c><00:00:17.359><c> build</c><00:00:17.600><c> it</c>

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; They build the stuff, but they build it
 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; They build the stuff, but they build it
much<00:00:18.400><c> better.</c><00:00:18.960><c> So,</c><00:00:19.119><c> that</c><00:00:19.279><c> means</c><00:00:19.600><c> data</c>

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
much better. So, that means data
 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.269 align:start position:0%
much better. So, that means data
centers,<00:00:20.640><c> much</c><00:00:20.880><c> less</c><00:00:21.199><c> usage,</c><00:00:22.080><c> etc.,</c><00:00:22.480><c> etc.</c><00:00:22.880><c> So,</c>

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
centers, much less usage, etc., etc. So,
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.590 align:start position:0%
centers, much less usage, etc., etc. So,
there's<00:00:23.519><c> a</c><00:00:23.680><c> lot</c><00:00:23.760><c> of</c><00:00:23.920><c> things</c><00:00:24.400><c> downstream</c>

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things downstream
 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.029 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things downstream
&gt;&gt; and<00:00:25.840><c> and</c><00:00:26.000><c> I</c><00:00:26.160><c> think</c><00:00:26.320><c> this</c><00:00:26.480><c> is</c><00:00:26.640><c> this</c><00:00:26.800><c> is</c><00:00:26.880><c> the</c>

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and and I think this is this is the
 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.390 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; and and I think this is this is the
lynch<00:00:27.279><c> pin</c><00:00:27.519><c> for</c><00:00:27.599><c> me,</c><00:00:27.760><c> right?</c><00:00:27.920><c> A</c><00:00:28.080><c> lot</c><00:00:28.240><c> of</c><00:00:28.320><c> this</c>

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
lynch pin for me, right? A lot of this
 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.990 align:start position:0%
lynch pin for me, right? A lot of this
is<00:00:28.640><c> like</c><00:00:28.800><c> I</c><00:00:28.960><c> had</c><00:00:29.039><c> this</c><00:00:29.199><c> epiphany</c><00:00:29.599><c> today.</c><00:00:29.840><c> I'm</c>

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
is like I had this epiphany today. I'm
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.950 align:start position:0%
is like I had this epiphany today. I'm
like,<00:00:30.160><c> "Oh</c><00:00:30.560><c> my</c><00:00:30.880><c> goodness,</c><00:00:32.079><c> we're</c><00:00:32.399><c> done."</c><00:00:32.719><c> Like</c>

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
like, "Oh my goodness, we're done." Like
 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.069 align:start position:0%
like, "Oh my goodness, we're done." Like
like<00:00:33.120><c> it's</c><00:00:33.360><c> not</c><00:00:33.520><c> that</c><00:00:33.680><c> we're</c><00:00:33.840><c> done</c>

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
like it's not that we're done
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.190 align:start position:0%
like it's not that we're done
