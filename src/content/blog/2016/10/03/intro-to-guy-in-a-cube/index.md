Kicking off my video series for PowerBI.Tips I have to give incredible props to Adam Saxton. Adam is a Microsoft Employee who creates THE BEST content for PowerBI.

## Why Guy In a Cube is Great

There are a lot of videos out on the internet that are interesting and helpful to learn from. However, Adam takes it to another level. The videos are relatively short and packed with useful information.

Below is the introduction video to Adam who is The Guy in a Cube.
