In the day to day operations of businesses speed of delivery, cost effectiveness, and satisfaction of outcome is a trifecta of challenges we run against as report authors. Picking and choosing what parts to deliver, and when, determines the overall success of a given report. However, we typically can’t do all at the same time. As a result, we need to keep in mind that there should be a process or cycle of continuous improvement to ensure we are making the biggest impact to the business. In this episode we dive into these areas and more to discuss how to improve upon our solutions and what tips & tricks you can use to ensure you are continuously improving user experience.

## Ways to Improve User Experiences

A few ideas that we mull over and explore in depth are how do you elicit or collect the feedback that would prompt you as the report author to understand what areas you could improve upon. Are you performing surveys? Are you analyzing or generating reports off the metrics that you have access to via the [Power BI Service to understand usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-modern-usage-metrics). Are you tracking and managing against the overall influx of requests or tickets and are those going down as you solve problems? Are there tools that would help you dive deep into the tracking and dependencies of a report? We answer all these and more so be sure to check out our conversation.
