When the moon hits your eye… If Dean Martin were still alive and loved Power BI as much as we do… Do you think he might change up the lyrics of his song? He would likely add a location like Chicago, add a pair of Italians that rarely grace small audiences together. And mix in an evening with in person and online attendees alike. Unlucky for us, we’ll never hear that song. Fortunately for us, we have two of the foremost experts in modeling and DAX, a location in Chicago, and over an hour to host an in person AMA!

Mix together the good times we like to have. A live audience, a live broadcast, and some serious brain power answering all your DAX and Modeling questions. That sounds like a sweet melody that can carry a night through. We are thrilled that we can host Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari from [sqlbi](https://www.sqlbi.com/). Join the whole crew of the [Explicit Measures podcast](https://powerbi.tips/explicit-measures-power-bi-podcast/) Tommy, Mike and Seth as we host this live AMA. We look forward to the conversation that will be mostly driven by YOU the community.

We’ll be hosting this special event in **Chicago at the Chicago Power BI User Group on November 10th from 6pm to 8pm CST at the Microsoft Office downtown**.
