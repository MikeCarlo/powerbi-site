This video talks about how to create custom links that apply report level filters.  This is super cool and provides a ton of wide flexibility when building drill down reports.  In this example Patrick talks to filtering a report based on a Sales Person (Lilly Code).  Great technique for drilling down into subsets of data within a report.  If implemented in correctly this will enhance the user experience.

Dynamic filtering with PowerBI:

In the above video Patrick has referred to a previous video done by Adam talking about report filters within the URL query string.  For convience I have linked the referred video below, so you can watch it all in one place.

If you haven’t already make sure you go check out [Adam’s site](https://guyinacube.com/) and [YouTube Blog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFp1vaKzpfvoGai0vE5VJ0w) for more great information.
