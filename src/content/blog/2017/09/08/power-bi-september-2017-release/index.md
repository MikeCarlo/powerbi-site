September is here and there is a new update for Power BI desktop!  I’m so excited for this month’s update as there are many solid features.  One of the more anticipated features, Drillthrough.  This allows a user to right click on items in a table and drill to more detailed pages within the report with applied filters specific to the user’s need.  This feature was initially announced at the 2017 Data Insight’s summit.

Another feature that is definitely worth checking out is the ability to now create more detailed themes for a report.  More of the properties of a visual are now being exposed in the [JSON format for themes](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-desktop-september-2017-feature-summary/#theming).  For people who do a lot of customizing of visuals this is a huge time saver.  PowerBI.Tips has provided a tool to assist you with generating your own report themes.  Click the image below to go to the improved [Report Theme Generator](https://powerbi.tips/tools/report-theme-generator-v3/).
