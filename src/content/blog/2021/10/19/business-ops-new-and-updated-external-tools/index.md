Howdy, folks!

This past weekend, I was a man on a mission. There were two pressing reasons for a new release of Business Ops:

1.  The authors of many popular External Tools released updates recently, so we needed to ship a new version of Business Ops with those updates included
2.  Last week, Michael Kovalsky ([ElegantBI.com](https://www.elegantbi.com)) released a brand new External Tool called [Report Analyzer](https://www.elegantbi.com/post/reportanalyzer) (which we can already tell will be an instant classic), so we wanted to get it out there and into the hands of report developers ASAP

So, I toiled away most of the day on Sunday, cramming as much value as I could into the next version. And along the way, I learned some important new software development skills, including how to:

*   [Extract the contents](https://github.com/activescott/lessmsi) of an MSI installer file
*   Encode an image in base64
*   Roll back your latest commits when you accidentally push to Main instead of a Dev branch (sorry, Mike! ?)

* * *

## TL;DR: Here’s the skinny on Business Ops 2.0.3

New External Tool:

*   Michael Kovalsky’s Report Analyzer ([blog post](https://www.elegantbi.com/post/reportanalyzer)) ([Git Repo](https://github.com/m-kovalsky/ReportAnalyzer))
