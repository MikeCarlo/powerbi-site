First of all, go read this amazing blog put out by Alberto Ferrari over at SQLBI that he posted awhile ago. It is the context for the conversation we had and is well worth the read. [7 Reason DAX is Not Easy](https://www.sqlbi.com/blog/alberto/2020/06/20/7-reasons-dax-is-not-easy/) If you are new to DAX you will find a wealth of deep, insightful and helpful content in anything you find on SQLBI. Marco and Alberto are amazing guru’s in DAX and tabular models and have been perfecting their craft and helping the wider community hone their skills for many years.

I’m not going to re-hash the article as you should go read it yourself on their site. The points we talk about in depth in the podcast relate to focusing on the best methods to approaching and learning DAX. We take our experiences and the methods we learned and discuss at length the different points made in the article. Explore with us how you get better and overall simplify your process when building or troubleshooting DAX.
