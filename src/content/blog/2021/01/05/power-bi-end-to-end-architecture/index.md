### How it started / How it’s going

If you are on social media at all you will see meme’s about How it started vs. How it’s going. In the thread of Melissa’s tweet we have a fun image showing the progression of Power BI End-to-End architectures. The number of changes since 2015 is absolutely stunning. Power BI has grown up a lot since 2015. That being said, I’m greatly encouraged to see the Microsoft Power BI team pushing amazing new features.
