This month we did a webinar with the Microsoft team on how to build different custom visuals in [Charts.PowerBI.Tips](https://charts.powerbi.tips/) a version of [Charticulator](https://charticulator.com/).

If you haven’t seen Charts.PowerBI.Tips this video explains the program, all the functions of each button and building demos. We walk through all the buttons on the tool bar and what they do. Finally we build multiple different charts. Check out this webinar if your curious about building custom visuals with no code.

I want to give a super big thank you to the Microsoft team especially [Kelly Kaye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellykaye/) for making this video happen.

Thanks for watching and have a Wonderful Day!
