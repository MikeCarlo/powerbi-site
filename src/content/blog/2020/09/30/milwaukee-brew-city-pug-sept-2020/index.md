We were excited to welcome a good friend of PowerBI.Tips [Alex Powers](https://itsnotaboutthecell.com/about/) to speak with us at this months PUG meeting. Alex blew a bunch of minds by diving into the depths of Calculated Columns and the love or hate relationship we should have with them.

Calculated Columns are a common element to the new users. Those users typically come from a default analyst mindset of “see the data” then perform the calculation. This pattern can lead to a bunch of performance issues. Alex shows us how to be intentional with our decision making and provides some solid advice throughout. Be sure to check out this video as it is packed with great insights and conversation around this topic for the beginner as well as the long time expert.
