This month we got the Power BI desktop update a little bit later because it was released during the [2020 Ignite conference](https://myignite.microsoft.com/home). As always the MVPs are super excited to talk about the latest Power BI features.

This month’s release was packed with all sorts of new features. For a full list of features read the [official Microsoft Blog post](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-september-2020-feature-summary/). Some of our favorite features that the MVPs talked about are:

*   Search for a workspace during publishing
*   Premium Per User (PPU)
*   Maintain Visual Layer Order
*   Databricks Connector
*   New Icon
