Daniel Marsh-Patrick is a custom visual developer who recently released the HTML Content, a custom visual. This month we go over this visual in detail with it’s creator himself.

While this visual is currently at V1, Daniel shows us a preview of V2 and trust me you will absolutely love it. I’m so looking forward to using this visual in my daily workflow. As well as V2 is going to be amazing.
