The Power BI Field Finder created by Stephanie Bruno was just updated. In this recent update the HTML viewer has been updated since the old custom visual has been deprecated.

## What is Field Finder?

We are glad you asked. The Power BI Field finder is a tool that can be used to review all the relevant connections between tables, measures and visuals within a report. This solution is easy to use and very informative. Simply point the Field Finder at a PBIX file. Then the Field Finder tool will de-construct all the visual elements of the report and digest them in to one complete data set.

## Why do I need it?

If you have done any Power BI development over the years, you will notice a pattern.

*   Start building a report
*   Create some measures for a visual
*   Measures don’t work or report needs changes
*   Make more measures
*   Delete and replace visuals
*   Add visual styles and elements requiring additional measures
*   Finally publish report

After completing this process, which could be over the span of days to months. You will likely have a Power BI report with extra measures or un-needed calculated columns.

Then you are introduced with a problem, How do I go through and clean up the entire report? Do I need to click on every single visual to see which measures are used?

Doing this for a page or two you quickly are overwhelmed with tracking all that information. This is where Power BI Field Finder really shines. It handles all of that for you with a couple button clicks.
