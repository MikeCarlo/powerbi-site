We just completed an amazing webinar from [Parker Stevens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pstevens33/) over at [https://bielite.com/](https://bielite.com/) . In this webinar, Parker walks us through how to connect to the Power BI Admin APIs. The Admin API contains a wealth of knowledge for all activity within your Power BI tenant.

While there is a good amount of reporting built into the Power BI admin page, you may need more. This is why you would use the Admin APIs to gather all the activity data from within your Power BI. For more information, [learn about the Power BI Admin Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal).

Parker takes us through a deep dive connecting to the Power BI admin apis and shows us how to build a robust dataset ready for Admins to produce the reporting they need.
