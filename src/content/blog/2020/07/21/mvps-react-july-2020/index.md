This month we are trying something brand new. We are introducing a new series called MVPs react. As you may already know Power BI has monthly desktop releases. If you are as excited about these releases as I am I love talking about all the new features. So, why not get a fun group of MVPs together to discuss everything.

These events are similar to a fire side chat about Power BI among the best experts within the community. We hope you enjoy the conversation, and learn a couple new things as well.

Here is our session for the Power BI desktop release for July 2020.
