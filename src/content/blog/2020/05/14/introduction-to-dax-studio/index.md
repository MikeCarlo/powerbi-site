Darren Gosbell & Marco Russo join PowerBI.Tips in a 4 part series on how and why to use DAX Studio! They show us why **DAX Studio is the ultimate tool for working with DAX queries!**

In this first session we are joined by Darren who gives us a little history on DAX Studio and how we can get started with downloading the tool and getting it up and running. He covers many different areas of the tool including connecting to our various models, the basic functions of the tool, how you can output the results, and everything you need to know to get started.  
Be sure to check out this video and all the rest in the series.
