The Milwaukee Brew City PUG for April kicks off with some quick updates and highlights of upcoming events. We spend a quick minute on why we’re so excited about the fantastic line up of webinars that we were able to do recently. They highlight the top 3rd party tools to get the most our of your Power BI experience. We were excited to welcome a brand new Microsoft MVP – Chris Wagner to speak to us in this April PUG. He walks through How to **Build a World Class Center of Excellence for Power BI**. We also had some great conversation around a myriad of topics at the latter half of the meeting, so be sure to stick around to catch some of that at the end.

## Enjoy the Meeting!
