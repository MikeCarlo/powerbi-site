Here we are, jumping in to 2020. This Month PowerBI.Tips is kicking off and sponsoring the next year of Power BI user groups (PUGs) for Milwaukee. If you are not participating in your Local Power BI User Group we highly recommend that you get plugged in. Power BI User groups are intended for like minded Power BI individuals to get together and learn from each other.

If you don’t have a User Group you can follow along with our group. We record each user group and post the highlights from the 2 hour event. This month we go over the top three most popular blog posts from 2019. Then we demo creating a Paginated report in from a PowerBI.com dataset. Finally we publish the Paginated report into the PowerBI.com service for end users.
