In the September 2018 blog post the Microsoft team released a new layout.  This layout has a number of really nice design elements.  However, upon reviewing the file used for this demo [found here](https://github.com/Microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/tree/master/2018).  Upon downloading we noticed that the new style of the layout was only one page deep.  As an enhancement to this file we added all the pages, renamed all the elements and created a full PowerBI.Tips layout from this page.  We’d love to share our work with you and hope you enjoy this new layout from PowerBI.tips.
