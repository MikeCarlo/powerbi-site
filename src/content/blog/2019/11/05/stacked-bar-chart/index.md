For this week we are building a stacked bar chart on [https://Charts.PowerBI.Tips](https://charts.powerbi.tips). While you can build this type of chart within Power BI Desktop this video is more of an example showing how you can build a similar custom visual chart. There are two areas that i’d like to point out.

1.  When working with a chart you can add a Legend to a shape object ([2:40](https://youtu.be/Omt-Swzluuk?t=162))
2.  Adding a grand total requires an additional Glyph ([3:14](https://youtu.be/Omt-Swzluuk?t=194))

While these two tips are pretty simple it really does help you when building more complex custom visuals.
