## **Introducing the Gallery Integration in Wireframes to extract Scrims**

The Gallery Integration into Wireframes for Scrims is a feature designed to streamline the theme building process even further. It is particularly valuable for users who have invested time and effort in crafting their own themes. This feature brings the power of the Gallery background images (Scrims) into the Wireframes section. This allows users to access all the projects available in the Gallery!
