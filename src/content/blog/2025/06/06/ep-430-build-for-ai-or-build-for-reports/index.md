# Ep. 430: Build for AI or Build for Reports?

In this episode, Mike and Tommy dive into the evolving role of AI in Power BI. With Microsoft pushing Copilot integration everywhere, they question: Should we build semantic models for classic reporting or tailor them for AI consumption? They break down the latest features from Microsoft Build, including tools to prepare your data for better AI interactions.

## In the News

### Prepare Your Data for AI in Power BI

Microsoft has introduced features to enhance Copilot's performance with your semantic models. Key tools include:

- **AI Data Schemas**: Select specific tables and columns for Copilot to focus on, reducing noise and improving relevance.
- **AI Instructions**: Add custom guidance, business context, and rules to help Copilot generate accurate, aligned responses. Available in Power BI Desktop and service.
- **Verified Answers**: Pin exact visuals as responses to common questions, ensuring consistent and trusted outputs.

These features aim to bridge the gap between your data and natural language queries, making AI more reliable for business insights.
