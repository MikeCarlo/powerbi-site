## News & Announcements

This episode’s news links point to practical branching guidance and community tooling that helps teams ship analytics changes safely.

- [Release Branching Model for Power BI Projects (pbi-tools)](https://pbi.tools/devops/release-branching-model/) — pbi-tools proposes a release branching model designed for enterprise Power BI projects, emphasizing predictable release cadence and guarding production through workflow-driven deployments. It focuses on enabling parallel development while keeping main aligned to production and using automation to reduce manual deployment risk.

- [Fabric-Analytics-MCP (LinkedIn Post)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thisissanthoshr_githubcopilot-microsoftfabric-analytics-activity-7343922198954356739-3dyR/) — A community project that exposes Fabric analytics workloads through an MCP server, making it possible for AI assistants to interact with Fabric resources using standardized tooling. It’s an interesting glimpse into where conversational ops and automation could go for data engineering and monitoring.

## Main Discussion: CI/CD Branching Strategies

Mike and Tommy walk through why branching strategy matters, especially when you’re trying to balance speed, safety, and collaboration. They frame branching as a set of rules that make releases predictable and reduce “merge hell,” then compare the tradeoffs of the most common strategies.

### GitFlow

GitFlow introduces multiple long-lived branches (develop, release, hotfix) to manage parallel work and formal releases. The upside is structure and clear gates; the downside is complexity, more merging, and slower lead time—often prompting even more branches to compensate.

- [Hello Serverless, Goodbye Git Flow](https://articles.merapar.com/hello-serverless-goodbye-git-flow) — This article argues that GitFlow’s complexity can become a bottleneck for fast delivery. It highlights the organizational impact of slow release processes and explains why simpler flows often enable more frequent production deployments.

### GitHub Flow / GitLab Flow

These flows tend to simplify the model: short-lived branches, pull requests, and a tight feedback loop. The team discusses how these patterns can work well when you have strong automation and consistent review practices.

### Trunk-based Development

Trunk-based development pushes teams toward small, frequent merges and heavy reliance on automated tests and feature flags. The payoff is faster integration and fewer long-running merge conflicts, but it requires discipline and tooling maturity.

- [What Are the Best Git Branching Strategies? (AB Tasty)](https://www.abtasty.com/blog/git-branching-strategies/) — A high-level overview of branching strategy concepts and why teams adopt rules around branching, merging, and releases. It frames branching as a way to protect the mainline while enabling parallel work without derailing delivery.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=0s" target="_blank">0:00</a> [Music] [Applause] Welcome back everyone to the explicit measure. podcast with Tommy and Mike. We're excited to have you all here. We

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=31s" target="_blank">0:31</a> I've got some great topics I think again today. And our main topic today, we even debated a bit on the title here. Tommy and I were kind of going back and forth here. We're going to talk about a deep dive on continuous integration, continuous deployment, CI/CD branching strategies. I know, riveting. People are going to be like clamoring. We've gotten so many questions around what is a branching strategy and how does this fit my organization. So that's what we're going to unpack today. I will admit when Tommy and I were kind of more u

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=61s" target="_blank">1:01</a> Working on this initially. I didn't really realize or understand there was different strategies or different branching patterns you could use with CIC. And now that I know a little bit more, I'm like, okay, I can now recognize these patterns that people are talking about and I can put a name to them, which is great. So it's adding knowledge here. Mike, you'll know when you have some real fun. I'm not even kidding. this morning and I I really should have stopped doing this to my wife and let her have her coffee before I start getting into this. But oh boy, anytime you talk to your wife before coffee, it's a bad it's a recipe for

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=91s" target="_blank">1:31</a> Disaster time. Like look and I'm telling her like I was telling about the age of fabric and I was five careers. something like this other idea about Git. Can you humor me? And she said fine because she it's like so I'm like all right it's hard to explain and but it takes it takes skill to explain it to someone who is not a developer much less tries to understand it. I think I did a pretty good job. It's like okay your word you have a Microsoft Word file. Well what if you want to make a change and you didn't want that to go immediately to save for everyone. Well

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=122s" target="_blank">2:02</a> We have this idea of called a commit. And I said, "After coffee, we'll talk about branches." And like I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. We're done. We're done. We're I've understood it. it it's tough to find like a real world analogy that works well inside the git branching space, right? So I mean it's like I have lots of little things that I'm going to change and not all of them are the same and some of them I'll change but other ones I won't. And so how do you yeah it's it's definitely a more

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=153s" target="_blank">2:33</a> Advanced concept but very much needed in what we're doing. Oh it's going to be huge today and maybe she'll listen today because my wife did take dashboard in a day. [Music] Maybe probably not. Probably not. every so my wife and my kids sometimes catch the podcast every so often and what they'll do is they'll listen to the first little intro because we'll talk about life or whatever and then probably about after like 30 seconds they're like yep we've had enough this is the we're done

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=183s" target="_blank">3:03</a> We're going to move on they're they're talking too technical terms and we don't even know what they mean so what did you think about keep all filters click click on to the next thing all right let's do a couple quick news items here Tommy you found our our guest actually found a amazing article Today Santosh which is the gentleman who's really working on top of the fabric spark experience has announced something on LinkedIn. Tommy, what's this? What is this that we found? Oh man, we got some

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=213s" target="_blank">3:33</a> More MCPS model context protocol. Again, this is another huge thing around the AI space. And for a lot of you, if you're still adverse like I don't know how much to dive in, dive in. Go head first into the AI pool. And what Santos has been able to develop here is this idea again these extend a lot of your AI tooling most notably claude anthropics cla tooling but also works for cursor and other and VS code as well. This idea around this model context protocol or

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=243s" target="_blank">4:03</a> MCP is allows you to inense in a sense get extended knowledge around that AI. The AI is an additional knowledge it can pull from. Now anyone can develop these are open source and the one that Santosh did is around fabric and this is the fabric's analytics MCP which simply allows you to again allow claude or those other tools to understand what's going on in your fabric environment. So the kind of tagline here is chat with your fabric's data and that engineering

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=274s" target="_blank">4:34</a> Workload. And what this allows us to do, Mike, and again, this is just I love I love this stuff so much. What this simply allows us to do, and again, it's using APIs in the background, but for you, I can be in my AI tool of choice and simply say, what? Hey, what's going on right now? Or let's create a notebook. I need to create a notebook or I want to view a notebook that I already have. Well, it's not going to pull up fabric. It's all going to happen through the interface you're in. So what's neat about this the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=304s" target="_blank">5:04</a> Possibilities Mike here is I can be in Claude just in a normal chatbot so to speak that agent working through that I could even be in VS Code in a Git environment that I already have and let's create something real time and that should show up in that in your environment. So there's a lot of opportunities here, Mike. This is going to change. This is again I I see the game very quickly changing under my feet here very very fast. And so a couple links I put some links in the chat here.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=335s" target="_blank">5:35</a> One link is for the blog article on LinkedIn from Santosh. Awesome. Thank you Santosh for the details on that one. If you want more details, you need to follow the second link here which is actually the code he presents from which is code he published to his private repo. So, it's under Santosh's name. but then you'll also notice here key features. I just want to read through some of these because I think these are important. Complete CRUD complete create, read, update, delete for all fabric items or for fabric items, just not all items. Be weary, be careful.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=366s" target="_blank">6:06</a> Libby API integration. So, full Spark session and batch job management using the MCP. Spark application monitoring. So, real-time monitoring across all workspaces and items. Awesome. Cloud desktop ready a plug-and-play integration with cloud desktop enterprise authentication which is again one of the things that we're always concerned about. How do we get into this the and talk to them? You can use bearer service principles device code and interactive mal integration Microsoft

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=396s" target="_blank">6:36</a> Identity authentication library for secure enterprise access. So that's also integrated. analytics and insights generate comprehensive monitoring dashboards, comprehensive testing, write extensive tests with real API validations. And then token management, automatic token validation and expiration handling. There's a lot of features on this one. Yeah. And when I read this article, he says, what did he say? I'm thrilled to share this model context protocol

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=427s" target="_blank">7:07</a> Had started it as a weekend project with GitHub co-pilot. So it was vibe. It was vibe coding. Vibe coded. So yeah, I'm impressed. And I think with vibe coding, we're going to see a lot more of these kind of projects, side projects, just turn into like part of the actual product or something that you can go get and use with the actual product. This is cool. Anyways, I've got to figure this out. There's a whole lot of things here. Documentation is extremely long, which is probably written by AI. That's why they're so robust and it's there, which is great. That's what I want to see.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=458s" target="_blank">7:38</a> So I'm going to have to go unpack this a bit and see how this works. I got to be honest, I've only played with MCP slightly. I haven't really gotten into it yet. So, I've I feel like I'm I'm missing out on things here slightly. So, here's one of the things that I I'm really impressed with with Copilot doing this. And honestly, for people listening, initially when Fabric came out, the the API was tedious. It was very C focused. they didn't have a lot of Python and if you wanted to build an app it really if you wanted to connect

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=489s" target="_blank">8:09</a> Or talk to your fabric in an API you needed to build a C# application it was really strange but what you mentioned here and this is I know it sounds weird to say the highlight here but you talked about open authentication which simply means that your browser can open and you can log in that way or you can use a service principle so the fact that we're making headways here cannot be understated on just how far we're getting with not just fabric but also these MCPs and again if you've not heard of the model context protocol or still

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=521s" target="_blank">8:41</a> Weary this is the time to look into it because I bet you too you can see something for your own application Mike Wednesday we're going to there's going to be the PowerBIt tips model context protocol done after my weekend after my weekend project it'll happen right I don't know what it's going to do but apparently I just need to call Santosh and say, "Hey, we need a weekend here. let's go hang out and build an MCP for PowerBI tips." Right? So, I I don't know. Again, this is one of the things

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=552s" target="_blank">9:12</a> I'm not quite sure I exactly understand how all this stuff is working. One of the things that that kind of baffles me a little bit here. So, in this whole MCP language, the idea is like you're sending a prompt to an AI and then the AI has context awareness of like an API layer behind the scenes. That's kind of what I'm understanding it being. But my understanding is the MCP is a piece of hardware, a machine or something that needs to run and it needs to run on some device. So we're kind of involving multiple computers, right? We're talking about Claude. Claude does not run on my

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=582s" target="_blank">9:42</a> Local machine. Cloud runs as an API call to the service. That's what the the you're sending a prompt to it. It's coming back with some information. The MCP is something that runs on like my local machine. And so we're basically giving control through the MCP to Claude and say, "Look, I'm going to talk to Claude. Claude, you need to talk to the MCP. MCP, you take what the Claude thing has done, translate it into API calls, and then go ahead and make the appropriate API calls to the back end and then do what you got to do." So to me, the front end observer, I'm just

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=613s" target="_blank">10:13</a> Talking to it in natural language, English, but it's kind of getting translated a couple times to actually do things that I want. And then I can see I think the other the other thing here too is the artifact like if I said create a new lakehouse with this name with these properties and some sample data in it or whatever right the MCP would be able to say okay the the claude would say okay I understand what you said here's how I translate it into language or API calls that the fabric would use and then it makes the API calls and then

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=645s" target="_blank">10:45</a> On the website I would see oh look an the lighthouse appears, right? So then I would say, "Oh, it did it. It made the action happen." So I think I think it's my mental model how I'm thinking about this. Is that right, Tommy? Let me give some examples that I use then and I think this will probably help understand what the MCP really what the potential is. So I and these can use in really an IDE like VS Code or cursor same ones. So I have one for example called the Windows CLI. That's an MCP that on behalf of me can run command line interface operations. So that's a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=677s" target="_blank">11:17</a> Windowsbased one or obviously you could do one for Mac. I have one also called sequential thinking that actually changes the agent's ability and how it actually processes your request or command. So you can combine them too. I have one called also the taskmaster that actually makes whatever I need to do into different tasks. It creates the task first. So let's take that example. I can say hey taskmaster and I actually would write that. Let's create a notebook that's going to achieve X, Y, and Z. You'll actually see it perform

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=708s" target="_blank">11:48</a> Utilizing both of those MCPs to create the task before it does anything. So, one, it can actually apply to a different API or tool or it's going to change how that in a sense agent operates, how it actually thinks or reasons. So it has a full extendability both on your machine or it can be on a server like notion or fabric or Gemini Google's API it can connect to that I have one for deep research so

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=738s" target="_blank">12:18</a> That one actually uses perplexities like hey before you do anything research this kind of application that I'm trying to do see if there's any examples out there then taskmaster I want you to create the task for it and I can have that all apply so it really it almost creates another in a sense tooling. So, it's really really neat. Awesome. Okay, we got to we got to cut the AI conversation there because every time I talk AI, it's like we talk about half the time in just AI and we won't ever get to the actual topic here. So, let's cut it there. let's get into our main topic today. Our

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=769s" target="_blank">12:49</a> Main topic today will be around sorry, I'm pulling my notes here again. deep diving on continuous integration, continuous deployment, branching strategies. There we go. Everyone's waiting with baited breath at this point. Oh my gosh. Can't wait. All right. Oh, we've got our Apparently, we got a caller. All right. Well, welcome to We're not good at this caller thing. We haven't done this enough to really make this a smooth transition, but that's the best we got for now. So, that's what you get for a free podcast. That's that's all right. welcome back, Matias.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=799s" target="_blank">13:19</a> We're happy to have you back on as a caller for our show. We appreciate you. Hello. How are you? Excited. Doing well. Well, we have gotten, and again, I'll say this publicly, this has been, we've gotten the most amount of positive feedback for these last couple episodes around DevOps, data ops, and CI/CD. We are very pleased that you are here with us, and we think that your wealth of knowledge is really helping out. People are engaging with it. I I think I think we've struck a chord here to some degree is people want to learn more about this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=831s" target="_blank">13:51</a> They're being told they need to be using this and no one really has like real information on this. Like there's no one actually discussing this real topic and and unpacking what does this mean for you like daily? Like what do I what can I do right now with this whole DevOps experience? All right, let's jump in here. Let's Tommy, maybe you want to frame out a little bit. Okay, we're talking about continuous integration, continuous deployment. Maybe we just quickly touch on that and then talk about the thing what we're gonna

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=861s" target="_blank">14:21</a> Actually talk about which is a branching strategy. Absolutely. Yeah. And it'll pull the context too. We've been able we've been looking at Mthus on for the last three episodes and kind of concluding today just talking about this idea around data ops, DevOps, source control and how does that mix with your development now in using fabric and PowerBI. For a lot of you, maybe you're finally converted to that new process. Maybe you just didn't have the knowledge on where do you start. And hopefully

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=891s" target="_blank">14:51</a> We've been able to do a good job of talking about the why, the what around here and the value that this really can entail. And we're we're kind of jumping ship here or really ending with a bang having this conversation which I imagine we'll have it again talking about really a little more of the technical side around not just the team process but now kind of shifting towards the technical process. So using all these tooling, using all these development ideas, there's this idea too. Mike and I have

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=921s" target="_blank">15:21</a> Mentioned this before. It's not always the best idea to do everything in your main branch. Well, some of you have laughed. Some of you gone branch, Tommy. Yeah, I only I only do code development in and I don't make mistakes. I just everything in Maine, right? And some people we're talking about trees and they're like what? Why I don't know why why branches are here. So today we're uncovering and we're going to unpack this idea of the technical process specifically around that CI/CD and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=952s" target="_blank">15:52</a> Specifically around branches and how does that work from kind of the global universal best practices. Is there a different process around PowerBI and fabric? Okay, by the way five minutes later he's like we're not talking about trees. I'm like, "What's you talking about trees?" I'm talking about main branching. Like, I knew I hate you because you went on mute. I went on mute. I got quiet. Then I You saw my smile go from like straight line to like, "Oh, he got it." It just took him

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=982s" target="_blank">16:22</a> A second. Yes, Tommy. If Mike makes a commit on Maine, does anyone hear it in the forest? No. No one does. Until my developers tell me, "Slap me on the wrist. You can't commit to Maine. You You're not allowed to work in production." Oh boy. So, so Mtheas, with that being said, what the heck's a branch and why should I care and it's not a tree. Oh boy. Right. Good question. actually, when I was listening to you earlier, I I I I felt a good challenge there because

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1014s" target="_blank">16:54</a> You said you were trying to explain to your wife the whole Git thing and you failed to come up with a good analogy for branching. I think I came up with one. Oh, I love it. Okay. So, let's imagine you're a painter, right? And you're you're rocking on a on a massive painting, where you constantly sort of continue to make changes and and add stuff. so if you're on your own and you you rock on on, the the actual main painting, let's say,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1045s" target="_blank">17:25</a> Think Mangelo, right? 16 chapel. right. Yeah. If you're if you're on your own, you're working directly on the the final piece, right? Every time you're you're you're adding something, some some new strokes, it's basically a commit, right? but you're you're working directly on main, you're working directly on I like this on on on the the the end product

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1075s" target="_blank">17:55</a> Here. Now, if you want to collaborate, let's say you have a team of painters, you don't quite like having someone right next to you, right? so you come up with some rules and you basically say everyone has to work in a separate room where they don't necessarily see so good what else is going on and and the rule is that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1105s" target="_blank">18:25</a> Somehow they get to take a complete clone of the current state of the painting into the room. then they can do whatever they want to do to it. And at some point they need to take it and and walk back into the main hallway and basically say I want to apply or I I want to replicate everything I've just done to my own copy to to the main one, the one that hangs in the hallway for everyone to see. Right. And so those rooms are branches. and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1137s" target="_blank">18:57</a> We you can easily imagine I mean I think that the the analogy goes quite far right because what if let's say you had a a building in in the bottom right corner and then two developers two paint sorry two painters at the same time decided to repaint the roof. Right. Yeah. they're going to have some difficulties when they come back to the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1168s" target="_blank">19:28</a> Main hall and I I want my I want my roof to actually be the one that everyone else sees. So this is this is how we then have Yeah. conflicts and how we need to figure out how to resolve them. So well Tommy I' I've already done this with Tommy. Tommy's got the he starts using oil paints, . I'm over here using water-based, right? I mean guy or pastel guy myself. Yeah. So like that that won't work. So like Tommy can go in his room and and oil paint all day long. I'm I'm using water-based paints. These

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1199s" target="_blank">19:59</a> Will not mix. Like we cannot put these two together. So someone's got to make the decision to say we all need to use the right kind of paint together. maybe you're using latex paint. I don't know. eggshell, whatever whatever the type of paints there, glossy finish. Tommy, we're not using glossy finish. We're going to be using eggshell pastel colors. But I think you're you're so Methus, you're hitting on I think some of the crucial aspects on why should anyone care about branching and what I'm hearing are really the crucial aspects here is we're talking about conflict.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1231s" target="_blank">20:31</a> We're talking about being able to develop with other people in a sense from a collaborative point of view and you're talking about resol resolution and to me those are the three things that make get and make source control or CI/CD what it is. Yeah, I like it. And and so when it now comes to branching strategy, it's all about how many of those parallel rooms do I have, right? How long is someone allowed to stay in there to do their own stuff in isolation? how soon and how

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1262s" target="_blank">21:02</a> Often do they come out to coordinate and and to compare and to figure out who, who wins? so it's stuff like that. do do I have in in front of my main presentation hallway, where the where the where the public picture is, do I have a staging area where all the old teams changes are somehow collated before I then go into the public space. So, it's

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1293s" target="_blank">21:33</a> Stuff like that. Yeah. And I think the mo the important thing for people listening and just to understand that every repository anything you do if you create it in GitHub you create in fabric has a central or main master branch which is the public facing one. This is the people walking across that building going oh I see what they're painting. There's always going to be a public or really in a sense default branch that the problem with a lot of us dumb people out there, what we don't understand is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1324s" target="_blank">22:04</a> We build a branch and you're basically painting on top of the wall that everyone can see. But what we're talking about today and what we're really introducing today is well no no we don't don't paint the wall though everyone can see. Let's go in the back. go in your room and those are the other branches that we started. So let's dive into this and Mike I I want to propose to you your not journey into this but when you got introduced to this idea

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1354s" target="_blank">22:34</a> Around branching or CI/CD was it in fabric where was that first introduction because I think a lot of people they when they look at this they go well it can't be just fabric right there's has to be this other idea so let let me this is a great tea up I think here to what we're going to really talk about today is like we kind of what was my journey when how did I start doing that? So my company does a mix of app development and we do PowerBI consulting. I started as a PowerBI consultant and then and consulting as our business that was our

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1385s" target="_blank">23:05</a> Main source of income. We're now moving more of our work to appbased development on top of PowerBI level things which has been a lot of fun interesting challenging but with that we have to become as your again I I'm going through the struggle that Matias you've described in in your in your prior work environments right I started with a small team it was like me and another guy and we started growing the team people more people came on board and now we're having to say okay we now have multiple people we have multiple painters trying to create these basilas of art and amazing applications that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1416s" target="_blank">23:36</a> We're building, the creme de la creme of great apps, right? So, as we're building these things, we now have to figure out how to work together. And so, who's building on what bit of code, how can I have someone work on a project for like a week or two and then pull them off and move to another project. So they have to be able to jump in, learn what's going on in the project, understand the codebase well enough. And then also people are going to be we have lots of branches on lots of different projects all at the same

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1446s" target="_blank">24:06</a> Time. We're a small team. Everyone needs to kind of put a hand in and help write code. So I understood this idea of main being attached to your app, right? So that made sense to me. Maine is the app. That's the thing that's in production. And that's kind of what we started with. Outside of that, I didn't really have a whole lot of other things. I started getting into Azure static web apps and with that you could build branches and then every branch gets a a build of the branch because that's just what Azure static web apps do. So now we're talking branching strategies and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1477s" target="_blank">24:37</a> Do we need to have a permanent dev branch that always has a dev application before we get to production? Well, you only get burned so many times having a branch that needs to move over in domain where you need to actually have integration testing across different developers. Again, when you're one developer, you probably don't need it to live around forever. You build it, it goes into dev. Great. You do your testing, it seems to work, move it to production. But you've got three or four people now adding code to that dev thing, the integration tests. Well, one

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1507s" target="_blank">25:07</a> Person's work may have conflicted with another person's work, and I don't like how this is going together. So now now we've got to like figure out how to pull it all together. So that was my experience, but I never learned there were actual terms. I never studied it. I just kind of started using it and from other experience from other people and this is why I love again Matias, I'm going to really toot your horn here. I love working with you because you've got this experience. You've got 20 years of development experience here. You've gone through these pain points already. I know I don't know everything. And so

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1537s" target="_blank">25:37</a> Just having the conversations with you around, what should we be doing? What am I missing here that I'm not looking out for? And Matias introduced me to Git Flow, GitHub flow, GitLabs flow, and trunkbased development. And they all when you when you when you stand back and say, "Look, this is what CI/CD is." When you look at these different things, oh yeah, 100% they make sense. And even Microsoft, which I wish they would do a little bit more language around this, they have a great page in their documentation that talks about CI/CD workflow options in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1568s" target="_blank">26:08</a> Fabric. And I I'll put that in the in the link. Awesome awesome page of documentation. Nowhere do they call out any of these types of like standardized developmentbased workflows and they're actually showing you like they have a a GitHub flow that they've documented. One of the option is git based deployments, right? Option number two, git based deployments using build environments. Like they have all these patterns that you just see, but they don't actually call out like where they

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1598s" target="_blank">26:38</a> Came from. And so I really want to just kind of like unpack more of that. And so in talking with you guys here and and kind of unpacking this myself as I actually do app development, I now feel like I feel to me I feel like the best way to go around this is kind of around the trunkbased development for my team. That that seems to be like a thing that I want to use when I'm when I'm building things inside fabric. So that's what I like. I enjoy that one. It seems to work very well for what we're building here. But again, you have to figure out for your team. One, you need to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1629s" target="_blank">27:09</a> Understand what's out there and then you can kind of pick based on that pattern what makes sense to your team. And this is a maturity level, too. If you're a less mature team, you're not going to want to pick one of these more complicated deployment strategies. You'll want to pick a more basic one. get flow might be what you want to start with, something very simple, and then move your way up to more complex things. And it I think again, Matias, you'll probably weigh in on this as well. I think these different strategies change depending on the size of your team as well. Yeah. Yeah. apologies. I'm going to have to correct

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1662s" target="_blank">27:42</a> You on one thing here. No, no apologies. Again, this is me. I'm not an expert in this. I'll I'll fully admit that. So, Git Flow is arguably the most complicated workflow. that one has quite a history. It's it's going back to 2010 actually. And it's Yes. So it's it's not really a a good candidate for our term anymore, I would say. So there's a f there there's a famous blog post there's a famous blog post from 2010. It's still online from

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1693s" target="_blank">28:13</a> From the guy who originally came up with it. And that one is heavily overengineered. It has a number of permanent branches. You constantly have to merge between branches. And yeah, I'm I'm glad the world has moved on and we've got something simple now. So whenever I think about the the sort of the scale of of different complexities around workflows, I would put git flow on one on the far end in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1724s" target="_blank">28:44</a> In terms of it's complicated. on the other end I would say is trunkbased development where you effectively well I mean we can we can argue about definitions here but in a very strict sense trunkbased development means you only have a main branch and everyone rocks on on the main branch which is also probably not what you meant when you just said it Mike but yes and yes and no because that that is viable but only if you have really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1756s" target="_blank">29:16</a> Really good CI/CD in place, right? So if you if you have full automation, you can afford to commit directly into main because your CI/CD pipeline will will capture and kick out multiple environments and no will will find any potential problems right before you're testing. So, so the one thing which we need to be quite clear about is and and we we we've sort of implied that there's there's a direct

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1786s" target="_blank">29:46</a> Link here, but there's a difference between git branches and deployment environments and it's I think it's really important not to mix those up, right? So you you may well use a a git branching strategy where what happens to be in in a given branch directly mirrors what's in an environment but you don't have to right there are other ways of doing it. So I think again I'm I I threw the article down for Microsoft's

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1818s" target="_blank">30:18</a> Documentation on again this I'm trying to also liken what they're describing again their documentation that I just sent here in the chat is talking more about environments in concert with the branches not just the branches so again it feels sometimes the lines get very blurry here around what so I like having everything like I like having main attached to dev that's I like that one everyone kind of builds their branches separately we we put everything back in Maine and then from Maine we then put it into dev and then I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1848s" target="_blank">30:48</a> Use a deployment pipeline to kind of move things through the different environments. Not ideal in all situations cuz that doesn't sometimes address the data issues. but that's why we want to you kind of unpack this. But Mike, I think it's important what you just said here because there are kind of the the forefather in PowerBI to really having a CI/CD environment for for me for example, we had a dev workspace and a production workspace way back in the day. And this was simply the idea of we don't want to push everything that we're working on right away. So

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1879s" target="_blank">31:19</a> It's public facing. Correct. And before development pipelines, we had everything we worked in development. We would show stakeholders once they were happy with that we would delete that publish it to whatever production workspace kind of thing and it worked and it and it worked. Yes. But for a lot of people too I think the best analogy or the kind of the closest thing that's in PowerBI is the data pipeline or the or deployment pipelines deployment pipelines. there's too many but and that simple idea where you had and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1910s" target="_blank">31:50</a> They they had test development or development test prod which to me did not make sense for powerbi just pure powerbi but a lot of people could create the two p two workspaces I had my development one for marketing and I had my production one and that straightforward way is and and again correct me if I'm wrong mus is in its most purest sense or the in its most simplest sense this idea around what we're trying to do with branches. Well, I was just going to come in on

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1941s" target="_blank">32:21</a> That because my my own experience, when whenever I kick off a new project, for instance, or whenever I, go to a client and and look at, how can we help them? I always start thinking about environments in terms of In addition to production, how many environments do we want to maintain? what makes sense in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=1971s" target="_blank">32:51</a> Terms of stakeholder interaction, in terms of how many different rock streams are in place at the same time, how many parallel development is going on? And once that's decided, once we know there's dev test pro or once we know there's staging and prot and then any number of of dev environments for instance, then from that it follows which branching strategies we're using. Branching strategy is something that that needs to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2003s" target="_blank">33:23</a> Align with the environments we're deploying into. and one follows the other and so maybe that could be a takeaway for today. That's what I would strongly recommend. Think about it that way because again right at the end of the day engineers have work because at the because they're building something that goes into production and and adds value. So I like to think backwards. So let me lean into that if you don't mind. I I really want to ask

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2034s" target="_blank">33:54</a> You. you said two things or the two things you evaluate in terms of the the structure or the methodology you're going to do at the end. What what do you what do you evaluate when you look at that the number of people the amount of data going through to choose that? Are you looking at the skill the amount of people? What goes into that evaluation before you actually say this is the going to be the git methodology or the git structure that we're going to use? Good question.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2064s" target="_blank">34:24</a> Well well two there are two points really. One is what's what's my release cadence? and the second is like that which guard rails do I have for something to become production? Right? So let me break this down a little bit. Yeah. So let's say I'm working on something that's very very agile and I'm making small and very frequent changes and the the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2097s" target="_blank">34:57</a> Guardrails for those are extremely low for this to go into production, right? maybe I know it's a website and and a designer, makes some small incremental changes to it. there's no need for this to be officially reviewed. There's no need to stage this for someone else to have a look at it, right? it basically means you you have a production environment and and maybe sort of a dev environment for your developers, but

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2130s" target="_blank">35:30</a> You don't need anything else, right? but let's say you've got a a product that has sort of huge I don't know financial impact and you need very thorough QA and you need official stakeholder sign off from outside your team right you definitely need a staging environment where those guys can actually review what you've done before they say it's okay to go into production right now most likely your develop

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2160s" target="_blank">36:00</a> Velopers are not going to push stuff straight into the staging environment. Most likely your developers are going to collate all their changes in in in a shared deaf environment, right? so then we've got deaf staging production. now what if you have something like fabric where we talked about this the other day, right? Where you you can't clone fabric as a system on on your laptop. you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2190s" target="_blank">36:30</a> You can fabric obviously only works in the cloud. So any developer if they if they want to work on their own, make their own individual changes, they're going to need some sort of private environment, some sort of private workspace or whatever you want to call it for the changes they're working on whilst they're working on it, right? every developer sort of needs a feature workspace at the minimum. So then we have feature workspace private

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2222s" target="_blank">37:02</a> Per developer. We've got dev workspace where all those changes get combined and someone can check whether they all work in conjunction. Then we've got a staging environment where the stakeholder reviews and then we've got production. Right. So it's I hope that makes sense. It it all depends on yes what's the what's the type of the project you're working with.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2252s" target="_blank">37:32</a> How many parallel work streams do I have? how do do I need to make this available to to some external people for sign off? I like this. I I think I think you you hit the nail on the head on a lot of pieces. I've I've worked in some teams that does like sometimes I'll be like why why on earth are we building four environments? Like again, I'm coming from the world of like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2283s" target="_blank">38:03</a> Thin app development, small teams, like not a lot of and so I've gotten involved in other projects where they're like, well, we have to have four environments. Like we have to have a development environment or devs and we need we have a whole separate group of people that you describe the feature and then you give it to a testing team and they need a version of this so they can actually do QA, testing, whatever you want there. Okay, now that we're done with that, now we go give it to the stakeholders. And so they need their own environment because the testers can't be then they've got to approve all the changes that the developers made beforehand and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2313s" target="_blank">38:33</a> Then they're once the stakeholders get through then you can move things to production. and I think that's that this makes a lot of sense. Some companies can do dev prod. Some pe some groups depending on your size could be just prod. Like you could you can think of this in different ways. And I think defining out how many environments you need, what are the different functions and what is your release cadence is really those are really solid points. Tommy, you you asked a question around skill level here. Yeah. I'm I'm going to gauge Matias a little

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2344s" target="_blank">39:04</a> Bit on this one. I'm going to give maybe my impression on this one. The skill level of people working in code and working with Git. I think this is in the BI space. My observation is not a lot of people know this stuff. And so I feel like a lot of times we're starting kind of from scratch in a lot of spaces and when I've worked with clients that are starting to get into this space to get integration for business intelligence, there's a lot of education that has to happen there. And it feels to me that it's very daunting for a lot of organizations. It's oh it's so complex.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2374s" target="_blank">39:34</a> I don't understand it. like let's but I think that's probably a failure on Microsoft or the community at teaching at large like it shouldn't be rocket science. It we need more this is not scary and and going back to like kind of like our very first conversation is taking the time to slow down to speed up on this. Let's learn what these things are. Let's really unpack the environments what we're going to do with our process. What is our release

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2404s" target="_blank">40:04</a> Cadence? Because I think once you align on those highle goals, you can then set aside some time to your point Tommy and physically educate and sit down. Here's what we're doing. And I think if you explain the goals and why you're doing these key milestones, look, we need three environments. Here's why. We're going to have a release every Friday or every Thursday and then we're going to debug and fix things for Friday. Like if you define some of those key, let's call it like the the what is it called? The OKRs, right? Here's some of our OKRs, right? An OKR for our team may

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2435s" target="_blank">40:35</a> Be a release every week, 52 releases a year. Maybe maybe that's something we're going to shoot for, right? If you if you set that as a high level organizational goal, that then trickles down into how we do development. So, every week a feature is coming in or something new is happening and we have that regular cadence or maybe it's every two weeks we're trying to get something out into production. that way. one of the things I have found is when I hand the code over to the testers and or QA team or the stakeholders, sometimes they

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2465s" target="_blank">41:05</a> Doodle around and they don't approve it. So, like we're sitting on a chain like the developers keep moving forward. We've got three or four changes potentially coming down the pipeline and we're still waiting for testers to approve something that's 2 weeks old. That can't happen. So, what's our what is in your process to, work with that team to get them to get the testing done and say, do you approve it? Can we move it forward or do we still have issues and we need to go back and fix things? So, I'll just pause there. Thoughts? Well, yeah. Well, it's fair what you said and I normally don't defend Microsoft, but unfortunately here I'm going to have to push back and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2497s" target="_blank">41:37</a> Disagree a little with you saying that this is a failure in Microsoft's side where we haven't gotten this. And again, as much as I'm wearing the Microsoft shirt, I have known to throw some shade. but that being said, I I think to me we're not at a point yet where like the failure to do git is like the failure to build a semantic model with facts and dimensions, right? So if you went to a client or someone on your team was building semantic model and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2527s" target="_blank">42:07</a> They had like a date a table for January, February, March, you would look at them with horror or anger go, how could you do this? Right? But we're not we're not near a point yet where this is a universally accepted thing. All five people listening here, great. You're going to you may take this to your team. But by no means is this part of the universal workflow of fabric or PowerBI. Should it be is a different question. Is it or is it like hey you have to do this best practices we do even at

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2558s" target="_blank">42:38</a> The basics scale of the GitHub a main and feature branch. That's I mean this is for still it is very niche to me. I think it's very niche. The reason I say this too is because I have a few clients right now where we're looking to push fabric and I'm like they are we're we're teaching them semantic models. I don't I see right now unfortunately the way I see it I see teaching them get and source control is low on the list of all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2589s" target="_blank">43:09</a> The things I need to teach them and all the things that they need to implement. And and again, I'm happy to hear the disagreement here, but if I need to teach them semantic modeling, I need to teach them report development. I think that to me just adds more confusion. To me, if I'm looking at the skill level of I'm learning, I you have to start with the basics. No. And I to me this is not a basic yet. H I think from my point of view the it's complicated and and and challenging

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2620s" target="_blank">43:40</a> Because of the first thing you said Mike right u there are so many different ways to use git today correct git as a tool git as such is just a really really low-level thing you can do all sorts of stuff with it right it's like a it's like a toolbox you can you can build a tiny little toy, you can build a mega city and not a lot of guard rails. So yeah there are choices and to be made around

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2652s" target="_blank">44:12</a> Branching let's just stay there right and and how you actually collaborate how do you make those decisions how do you even know what's available right so I think this is a challenge it we're not talking about a skill that's like I don't know how do I how do I build a performant measure in in a in a semantic model right I mean

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2685s" target="_blank">44:45</a> That's probably something which you can teach relatively easily because there are sort of finite and well-known aspects to it actually deciding how you're collaborating as a team and how you use tools like git and other things for it we're not at a point where we can just take any textbook and sort of just follow the guidance there, right? There there's a lot that goes into it. to and well, I mean, there are at

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2715s" target="_blank">45:15</a> Least two main reasons I think. One is it's a space that's constantly evolving. I mentioned Git Flow being 15 years old now. That used to be the hot thing and back then when it came out, it was a revelation. Nowadays, as I sort of tried to imply earlier, this is probably the last choice that people would go for. So, things change. and, tooling in in in the fabric space in particular, right?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2746s" target="_blank">45:46</a> If if you if you don't have tooling that supports your process choices really well, it's going to be a a a burden. It's going to be a churn, which is, why I made are making a massive investment with Navigator to actually tackle exactly that where we're actually looking what's what what are what are the big gaps what are the big problems with DevOps today and how can we address that with better tooling.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2778s" target="_blank">46:18</a> So yeah th those would be my thoughts here. and why why is it harder than it than it should be today? So I I want to unpack that tooling as important step here as well because I want to I want to just kind of talk about this is one of the areas that I think is not a disillusionment but it is a it is a how do I describe this one? I'll hammer it mid dude. the no I I think I think the tooling that we have today

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2810s" target="_blank">46:50</a> Provided in fabric we have deployment pipelines we have some simple things the patterns that Microsoft explains in their CI/CD workflow options in fabric I I believe option one they give you is a separate branch for every single environment so there's a dev branch that's permanent there's a test branch that's permanent there's a prod branch that's permanent and you're constantly merging between branches or or using some kind of devops thing to to move code between different branches to to make this work. My understanding that's git flow like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2840s" target="_blank">47:20</a> That's that's the there's multiple permanent branches and I could be wrong on that one. Is that git flow? Let me ask a question. Is that git flow? There's multiple branches tied to separate environments or am I just picking up something random? Show me git flow. Yeah. Behind door number one. arguably not I'd say. Sorry. Okay. So, so where does get so maybe I'm getting confused then between git flow and the other ones. So, which which one of these patterns and this maybe we

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2870s" target="_blank">47:50</a> Should talk about the patterns as well here as well. so let me finish my thought and then let's talk about patterns because maybe that would be good to clarify what these patterns are. Let's talk about each one of the and what they mean. There is a good article that I have attached to the description of this video that should have at least a description and a graphic and infographic of the different patterns you could potentially be using. so tooling today, what I see out in the community is a is a collection of Python, potentially notebooks, and PowerShell. That's the tooling that I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2901s" target="_blank">48:21</a> See today. Have you guys seen anything different as respect to tooling around CI/CD VS Code extensions? And Mike, this is such a good point because the the tooling that's available right now, if you were just to say, I'm not going to do anything. I'm not going to research. I'm just going to use what's in fabric. You have nothing. you have a process to push git around or code around. But once you go to the fabric interface, it goes oh do you want to overwrite everything you go or you can go to GitHub and see right very simplified. It's not meant

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2932s" target="_blank">48:52</a> For you to actually really review it. The if you want a prayer of having a ch a chance of managing those different branches, you need VS code and you need an extension, right? There is no good interface to manage any of this. So, I completely agree with you. Regardless if you're doing honestly, regardless if you're doing everything in Maine or if you're pushing anything through the different branching strategies, there is no by default tooling that's even close to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2962s" target="_blank">49:22</a> Helping you manage this to me at least. And I would love to hear if there's something different. Your thoughts, Matias, on that one? What's your lens on the tooling? Yeah, when when I mentioned tooling earlier, I wasn't even thinking about CICD. I was thinking about tooling in terms of helping team members follow the process around actually start creating a branch in order to begin work on on a new feature.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=2993s" target="_blank">49:53</a> Then creating PRs as in integrating their feature work back into some sort of shade so a shared environment or or branch right so things like that and well again you you mentioned fabric tooling right if if you use git integration which obviously is natively built into fabric. One of the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3026s" target="_blank">50:26</a> Big things that's bugging me, just to give one example, you made changes, but everything you're going to get in terms of feedback is this item has had changes. you can't there's no diff, you can't go any further. You're not going to only after you've actually committed it and pushed it back to your dev server, you won't see what's changed. And that's a massive antiattern when it comes to source control and and DevOps. a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3058s" target="_blank">50:58</a> Good git commit practices are all about making meaningful small granular commits. Give them good give them good commit messages and and keep the changes that are contained in that commit sort of as a unit of rock, . if he can't even tell what what the change is. leaving aside the fact that you could accidentally

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3090s" target="_blank">51:30</a> Commit something that you never meant to change to begin with. things have broken down quite badly. Right the way you're talking about this tells me how much you've been burned by this in the past. M you can hear the memory the posterity the pain you speak from a point of pain learning. So this is why I like talking to Matias cuz there there's so much wisdom and knowledge that you've already gone through here. So so let me talk is is a GitHub so let's say GitHub you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3121s" target="_blank">52:01</a> Know checking code in out of GitHub would we consider that would you consider that a a tool is that part of the tool that you're describing or is there a separate tool that you GitHub is a part of that tool but it's not the end solution that you're looking for maybe I'm maybe I'm missing or I'm just going to unpack what you're saying about the tooling specifically Matias so I I want tooling to helped me with every aspect of managing my project, right? And so to me that begins with

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3152s" target="_blank">52:32</a> What I explained earlier, at the beginning of a project, I think about and I plan which environments am I going to have? what are they called? Who's got access to them? Are they permanent? Are they temporary? then I decide which branching strategy goes with that. what are my branches called? in an ideal world, you would put a branching policy in place which ensures that your

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3182s" target="_blank">53:02</a> CI server actually rejects pushes to certain branches when you're not meant to push to them. Right? So this is this is the kind of tooling I'm talking about. If as a team you agree that no one's allowed to push into main and that everyone has to merge changes into main using pull requests in an ideal world you want tooling to actually enforce that not only are they not allowed they're they're physically not able to right so it's that kind of stuff. Second thing if we say and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3212s" target="_blank">53:32</a> Obviously that's definitely best practice for each new piece of rock we're creating a feature branch and we want to keep this feature branch as shortlived as possible. even so the individual developer now has the task of naming that branch something. So from my point of view, following a good naming convention is part of the tooling. Most importantly,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3243s" target="_blank">54:03</a> Also making sure that you clean up after yourself once you're done working on a particular feature and it's been merged. You want to make sure that this branch gets removed everywhere. again, this is also something which without good tooling, you're going to end up acrewing lots of mess in your system. so it's stuff like that. really basically the definition of stuff the the setup in terms of policies the setup around CI/CD but then the dayto-day guidance around I'm a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3274s" target="_blank">54:34</a> Developer I'm trying to do this thing help me create this branch help me make this commit help me create a pull request etc etc right okay good I'm I'm glad you're going down that route because I and the reason I'm I'm bringing this point up kind of as well here is inside the power there's a different UIs you can use to kind of start creating some of these experiences. for example, like if I'm in the fabric workspace or a premium workspace, it's called premium workspace

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3304s" target="_blank">55:04</a> Cuz premium per user also gets this as well. It's not just a fabric thing. So any premium workspace, you can connect that workspace to a branch that is inside of GitHub or Azure DevOps. Those are two tool those are two parts of the tooling pieces. Now in in the fabric UI you can click on create new workspace from branch. What it does is a very simple action of create the branch. Create a new workspace in fabric and then tries to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3335s" target="_blank">55:35</a> Deploy everything into that workspace for you. There's no ordering. It will not it it'll just deploy things as it thinks it needs to deploy them. There is no there's there's no I can't control it. Basically there's there's little to no control as a developer. And but to your point do Matias, there's there's this idea of we there's a whole bunch of interlocked pieces inside a single workspace. The notebooks attached to a single lakehouse. The the data that's in the lakehouse is different potentially than what's in your branch. You may need

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3365s" target="_blank">56:05</a> A different data or have to do a process where you need to load in some data to work on that branch while you're doing the development. So a lot of these other kind of like I can maybe call them checkboxes don't exist that I need to automate all of that. So while that works well, you can you can do that one option, right? The second option is you can go into Azure DevOps, you can go into GitHub and you can make a branch there. You can say click click a button, make a new branch, put your little name in, boom, done. You can do it from a CLI. You can do it in VS Code. Like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3395s" target="_blank">56:35</a> There all these other kind of really other cool experiences you can do this with, but then that's not automatically linked back to like where's the workspace? Did I deploy the things yet? So yes, I have a branch, but it does there's no reflection into again Matias, back to your point, it's a cloud system. If I'm going to work on it, I can't work on everything all in fabric, all in my local machine. I can't virtualize the whole fabric environment. I have to go use some of it that's inside the service. So where does that part live? So I think this is what I'm maybe trying to articulate here with the tool

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3426s" target="_blank">57:06</a> Conversation is there's little pieces of here that are missing that is causing me as a development or a team of developers. There's friction here. And so what's being used to solve that problem is Microsoft again, great job Microsoft, you're doing a good job getting better at this. This is way ahead of where we were like just using PowerBI. So it's gotten a lot better. I I'll admit that. But what we're getting from the Microsoft team or other people in the community, we're getting a whole bunch of PowerShell scripts. We're getting a whole bunch of like Python

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3456s" target="_blank">57:36</a> Things and it's all mushed together. Like I don't I don't really want to manage all that. Like I don't want it to be a whole combination of like automation through all these different languages. I want just the one tool to do it. Like let me go let me go to GitHub. Let me say create a branch. And in that create a branch action. It should do everything. It should make the workspace. It should copy these artifacts over. And I know for a fact I've had issues with like pipelines if you have like a main pipeline and then

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3486s" target="_blank">58:06</a> Sub pipelines behind it. And so if there's a dependency in one pipeline versus another, you have to start with the pipelines that have no dependency, deploy them first and then reverse deploy them up because you need the GID of the pipeline to be referenced in the second in the in the parent pipeline and and keep going back up. And so yeah, yeah, I want to I want to start from the git experience, create a new branch, and I want to have everything created in the order that I want them. I want everything rewired together correctly.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3516s" target="_blank">58:36</a> My lakeouses should be created and then my notebooks are attached to them correctly and all the gooid should match. Oh, and by the way, I already know I need data in there. So, what do we do with the data piece? I want that piece. Yeah. Do I want to virtualize the data through a shortcut? So, let's just make some automatic shortcuts so I can just build and test. But maybe I actually need real data there as well. So, maybe I need an option to say, well, I don't want to virtualize the data. I actually want real data. So, here's what I need to do. here's a pipeline or something a discipline and say build this run this pip. So do all this stuff,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3546s" target="_blank">59:06</a> Run this pipeline, go get the data from the development server, copy the last 3 months of data, put it in my lakehouse, and then okay, you're done. Ding. Like I want it to be like a microwave. I want to put my branch in the microwave. I want to set my timer and say go. And I want it to ding me when it's done. And I have everything ready to go and I show up to fabric and ready to build. Right. So that's that's the experience that I want. And we don't have that. No. What Mike's trying to say is the well runth deep. The well runth deep. It run. So, and I what what I I like to it's already

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3577s" target="_blank">59:37</a> Been an hour. I kind of want to see what then is if we know listen this continues the knowledge the experience what you need to know can expand on what we want what we need to know. So what is the NVT here? The minimal viable tooling that we need to know if I'm getting started if I want to jump in because like I like you said this can expand on really what we would love to have like in terms of from a dependencies from some automation but

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3608s" target="_blank">60:08</a> There's also I think here the basics that people can survive on. So if I'm if I'm in a fabric environment and to say just purely in the fabric playground, what's the MVT or MVP so to speak on what should I know from branching strategies? What should I know from tooling that's going to allow me to survive and thrive with fabric and using CI/CD? And and Methus, I will hand it over to you here. Maybe he didn't hear your question.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3642s" target="_blank">60:42</a> Oh. Oh no, lost. We might have lost audio. Mike, I'll hand it over to So here. So re reset your question. Let me let me hear it again. Yeah. What's the MVP here when it comes to what do I need to know the minimal viable tooling on what should someone know if they're going to play in the P fabric playground? okay. So let's just let's talk about like step one baby step into like full-grown steps at this point, right? So my my experience has been there is a synchronization that can

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3673s" target="_blank">61:13</a> Happen between the Microsoft UI and fabric and the workspaces. So when you have a workspace branch you can synchronize it and then there's this idea of like a deployment pipeline that goes like dev test prod. So talking about the environment things separately. I think the easiest place to get started with this git integration or even CI/CD in general is just let's just talk about backups like we're just generally going to talk about we need to have a backup of our workspace and because this is an to me this is an unblocker for organizations right so the unblocker is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3703s" target="_blank">61:43</a> I have semantic models I have data somewhere right or or a workspace that has code in it and all I really needed to be able to do is I need to be able to make changes in the service make changes locally make changes with publishing a PBX file and at the end of the day doesn't really matter where the change is made I get a copy of whatever that change is so to me early on in PowerBI I would very strongly suggest do not edit or create anything in the service

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3735s" target="_blank">62:15</a> Because I could not download it again and get a copy of it right if something went terribly wrong again Microsoft was really good about not breaking things but I was very adamant about not letting anyone touch that stuff. So, okay, fine. But on top of that, I said, "Okay, now that we have this new Git integration, just by turning on the synchronization, I can easily get in and out of that workspace. I can easily

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3765s" target="_blank">62:45</a> Make changes that I need to. So I think my step one my step one is really around being able just to get into the workspace and be able to add them in and out with that synchronization piece cuz then I can use deployment pipelines to go from dev to prod through the environments and then I can just start easy. So that's that's my starting point. Then there's another realm of this is when you start really getting to get and this is where I think Matias's tools are going to come into play here. I've seen some of them. So I I've seen I've seen this experience. Matias has built some stuff in Navadata where

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3797s" target="_blank">63:17</a> You go to GitHub, you create the branch, and everything's built for you, right? You have automation that goes behind and there's Okay, branch is created. Great. Now, I'm going to kick off a series of actions. New branch, deploy these things, put them out there, load some data, do some tests, verify it works, right? Good. Check. Done. Now my developer within within the UI of GitHub can then start cutting out branches and then whatever is deployed, it's automatically

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3828s" target="_blank">63:48</a> Deploying those things directly into your fabric workspace. So I have a named branch or a named workspace that I can go use and attach myself to. I really like No. And and I'll kind of do a little parallel with you and kind of expand on what we talked about where for me that MVP is understand the principles and get your environment set up right the first time. And when I say environment, honestly, man, I'm talking about GitHub desktop or VS Code. Have the right application tooling available

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3858s" target="_blank">64:18</a> For you before you really get started. But I think to me, it's the principles, right? Even if you just know the GitHub flow of a dev and prod and you start working that way, that's going to at least to get you understanding the PR principles, the concepts, right, where you can really get on your way, but you're not going to be successful or it's going to be very hard to be if you don't have a good you honestly user interface to do so. I would not rely on just the fabric service because again

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3888s" target="_blank">64:48</a> Point the point of this is not just that you're working in some weird environment is that I can see the changes occurring whether I did it someone else did it before goes to prod and you're only going to get that in a good tooling or really a good application some interface IDE so for me those along with what you said I'm going to expand on that and say make sure you get your workspace set up correctly the first time and get those core principles down and then just do a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3918s" target="_blank">65:18</a> Test with Devon prod and just get familiar, get comfortable with doing commits, get comfortable with the ideas of, oh no, that change should have never happened. What can I do? Oh, I can revert a commit. I can go back to another commit. Just basic principles. It's almost like you're getting ready to run a marathon. So focus on running, get the right shoes, and then you can get a little better on the like some more advanced features, but you're not going to get there unless you get comfortable with the basics. Yeah. And I I'll just I quickly call out here like the Microsoft

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3951s" target="_blank">65:51</a> Documentation for the CI/CD workflow options in fabric. I don't really like any of those options. I don't think those options are I don't I I think they're all just half thought through. They're okay. they kind of work, but I don't really love it because there's there's potentially a lot of heavy DevOps automation there that I don't really love initially. And again, yeah, let me be clear. I don't want to write a lot of PowerShell. I don't want to write a lot of Python scripts and notebooks and stuff. I don't want to do that. I want it I want the tool to just know what to do and just make it happen.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=3981s" target="_blank">66:21</a> What I want is I want the easy ability of saying, this is my main branch. Here's where I should attach it. I can release things with tags inside that branch. So I can then push to production when I want to. I can have testers that are able to see code and versions that release candidates for production items and then I need my developers to be able to build environments as needed with minimal friction and I need the data to be there wider audience too if I want available. None of Microsoft's documentation talks

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4013s" target="_blank">66:53</a> Anything about automation and how to autoload the data directly into these environments. It's just not there. So, I'm I'm confused around some of that part as well as I'm going to just quickly mute you, Matias, just because I'm getting audio back from your computer. raise your hand if you need to say something. So, so no problem. so with that, let's just do do a quick thing of final thoughts here. I know we're over time. this topic should probably be held on again. We we just barely started talking on some of the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4044s" target="_blank">67:24</a> The CI/CD pieces as well here. So, all this to say, check out the articles. There's a lot of details and documentation there as well. I'm going to push push towards that and make sure that the you have the ability to go read the documentation. Go figure out this stuff for yourself. We will probably talk about this in future episodes and bring in experts still to talk about more of this on the podcast. My final thought is just start somewhere, right? really talk about how many environments you think you need. Think about I thought I loved your

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4074s" target="_blank">67:54</a> Comments here, Matias, around what team functions do you have, developers, stakeholders, testers, people using things in production, and figure out what is your cadence for release code. I think if you answer those questions first, it will really help you align on some sort of process and build the process independently of the tooling and then you can kind of step back and work on that. So, I'll let me kick it over here to Matias. What's your final thoughts here as well? And I'll unmute. Can you hear me? We got you. I got you.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4104s" target="_blank">68:24</a> Fantastic. I'm so sorry. I just completely lost audio for the last 10 minutes or so. no worries. So, I I couldn't hear what you've been saying. either. if I may if if people are interested in a week's time I'm going to be doing a a user group presentation on fabric and PowerBI branching strategies one hour but very demoheavy where we we've mentioned different branching

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4136s" target="_blank">68:56</a> Strategies here. I'm actually going to show what they look and feel like in practice and and talk through that a little bit. it's the PowerBI user group Turkey. and it's I think 5:00 PM GMT on Thursday the 3rd of July. So there we go. that's coming. Other than that, someone said in the chat earlier this needs at least two hours. couldn't be more true. So, yeah, it feels like we only sort of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4169s" target="_blank">69:29</a> Scratched the surface a little bit, but hopefully people found it thoughtprovoking and at least have some pointers now in terms of taking this further. Awesome. And with that, I will I also found the link I found the link to the meetup event on for you, Matias. I think it's you said it was on coming up here pretty soon. I'm going to try and put this link in the chat window here. July 3rd, Thursday, 17 p.m. BST is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4199s" target="_blank">69:59</a> The time zone there. So, I'll put that link in here. That way, everyone, if they want to join, check it out on Meetup, go join the group. let's go overwhelm them with a lot of people. And I I think you definitely want to hear what Matias is going to be talking about over there as well. Tommy, any final thoughts for you? Absolutely. I just want to say thanks Matthias for having us. The last four episodes been wonderful. And again, I think for a lot of people, if you're starting this journey, it was intimidating for me. It it was very intimidating, but just get

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4229s" target="_blank">70:29</a> Comfortable with the basics. Just download VS Code, create a repository or clone one. It's so easy to get started. There's really not a lot of barriers to entry. So, I just recommend you see something you like on GitHub, download started like, oh, what can you do with this? And just understand that. Work on a development environment and fabric and just see what's in it. there's a ton here. And again, we unpacked a lot and we showed we showed how many boxes you can unpack here. That being said, you don't have to be an expert. You

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4259s" target="_blank">70:59</a> Don't have to know all things. There are some crucial things you need to know. And I would say get started there. And honestly, this is get started. Get started. I didn't even think of that. That's pretty good. So, get started. Get her done. But honestly, I would say just really truly begin your journey here. this is the future and I think for a lot of people whether you're working enterprise or midsize in fabric. This is going to be the default way that I think people

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4290s" target="_blank">71:30</a> Are going to pre prefer to work in. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm already preferring it. Like regardless, you should not be standing up a fabric workspace that is of any importance to your organization without attaching to get period. It should be it should be there whether it becomes elaborate in deployment and all these other kind of extra things that are on top of it somewhere you need to start thinking that way now from a career point of view get yourself get yourself ahead enough puns enough puns but all right that's all I got thank you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHYAUN4hxo&t=4320s" target="_blank">72:00</a> All very much we appreciate your time today thank you for listening to us and hanging with us a little over an hour today on the podcast we really appreciate your listenership we had a lot of people jumping in today so that was awesome very happy about that as well so at the end of the day here, all of this is just fun and also hopefully you learned something as well.
