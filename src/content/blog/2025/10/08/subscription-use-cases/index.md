## Main Discussion: Subscription Use Cases

### The Power of Push

Most BI assumes a "pull" model—users go to a dashboard. Subscriptions flip this to "push"—the data comes to the user. For many organizations, this simple change dramatically increases adoption:
- Executives who never log into the Power BI service get a daily email with key metrics
- Managers receive weekly snapshots without needing to remember to check
- Operational teams get data delivered at the start of their shift

### Creative Use Cases

Mike and Tommy share patterns they've seen work:
- **Daily KPI snapshot** — One-page summary emailed to leadership every morning
- **Exception-based alerts** — Subscriptions triggered by data conditions (combined with Data Activator for more control)
- **End-of-month close** — Automated delivery of financial reports to stakeholders
- **Client-facing reports** — Subscriptions for external clients on specific report pages with RLS

### The Adoption Nudge

Tommy recommends the book *Nudge* — and the concept applies directly. Subscriptions are a nudge:
- Low friction (data arrives in your inbox)
- Consistent (same time, same format)
- Builds habit (over time, users start clicking through to the full report)

### Limitations to Know

- Email-based subscriptions have formatting constraints
- Large datasets need paginated reports for full-fidelity distribution
- Subscription management at scale requires admin planning
- RLS must be properly configured for per-user subscriptions

### Practical Tips

- Start with your most important report, not all reports
- Target users who you know aren't logging in but need the data
- Include a clear call-to-action: "Click here to explore the full report"
- Review subscription usage periodically—dead subscriptions waste capacity

## Looking Forward

Subscriptions remain one of the most underused features in Power BI. Combined with the evolving notification and alerting capabilities in Fabric, push-based data delivery is becoming more sophisticated—from simple email snapshots to intelligent, condition-based notifications.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=36s" target="_blank">0:36</a> Explicit Measures podcast with Tommy and Mike. Hello everyone and welcome back. Good morning Mike. Good morning. How you doing? Great. I'm doing well. I'm just getting back in the routine of things. for those who are watching online, this is a pre-recorded episode, so just FYI about that one. , for those who are just listening on Spotify or other social media platforms, it will come out at its normal time. Also, I'll just make a quick pitch here. , if you would like to have the episodes as they are recorded and also you'd like to listen these episodes on YouTube with no advertisements, feel free to become a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=69s" target="_blank">1:09</a> Member. We are we have a a couple tiered members. We we call them our our fabricators. That's that's our community of people. And the lowest level is visualize this. And so when you join our visualize this group, you can get all these episodes for free. And if they are pre-recorded, we will launch the videos as soon as they are recorded. So Tommy and I are noodling on some ideas here that might also entice you to come over to become members in the near future here as well. So that being said, I like to visualize this an ode to a great movie.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=102s" target="_blank">1:42</a> Yes. well, there's the the different levels are visualize this. That's like your your entry level DAX DAX master, that's your next level up and then the full fabricator. So that that's your your final level, right? Awesome. All right, that being said, let's just jump into the episode. Tommy, today we're going to skip news and other items just because it's hard to do a pre-recorded one. We don't know what news is going to be coming out at the time of the episode. but any beat from the streets or any information that you've have that you've been working on recently? No beach from the streets. But I actually got

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=134s" target="_blank">2:14</a> Something I just thought a little spice it up a little. a little a little personal here. Mike, I'm a little miffed. We didn't talk about this before. You're like this. I'm a little miffed because since I've changed my background and professionalized, , the studio here. You've never asked me about my bobblehead to my I believe it would be my left on the screen. So sure. And I don't know. Do who that is? I don't if it looks like a baseball something or maybe Charlie Brown I can't quite tell but is he needs a bigger shirt is all I can say.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=166s" target="_blank">2:46</a> Yes he does. Well he was a little fat chubby kid but he's also the best backyard baseball player ever and it's from a computer game that I had when I was a kid. It's called Backyard Baseball. So I actually bought the thing on eBay because they only had it for like a minor league thing. I've is he was he was called the secret weapon and he was a little kid named Pablo Sanchez and it was probably my favorite computer game I ever played but that made as I was thinking like well Mike never asked me well I know Mike probably played a few computer games back in his day. Oh yeah

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=196s" target="_blank">3:16</a> You there's no way that you did. So I'm going to preface that with saying Mike what computer games were like your shining stars when you were a kid. Oh man that's a really good question. So when I was a kid, I remember really really wanting a a Nintendo was the original one. That's where I really wanted a Nintendo. And I our family never got one, but we did get a Sega Genesis. So one there was always like whenever I went to friends houses and they had Nintendo. We would always play a lot of Nintendo games. It was a lot of Mario Brothers 2. Like that was I think

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=228s" target="_blank">3:48</a> That growing up that was like one of the the big console memory games. Now if you move over to PC that was different. So we had PC for a little bit as well. , I think some of the main games I remember playing was I believe Civilization was one that was like really very early versions of Civilization. Sid Meers Civilization was really good. There was another game called Pirates that was again made by Sid Meers was also really good. Really like that one as well. , I remember one time my dad and I got into this civilization game

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=260s" target="_blank">4:20</a> And we were playing together like picking like what's the strategy? How do we move our places around? We really liked like the strategic, , it's it's like a risk game. It's like a turnbased game as well. So, we're picking these things and all of a sudden, like we look at the clock, we're like, it's like 2:00 a.m. in the morning. We're like, "Oh my gosh, we better go to bed. It's like a weekend, but still, we need to go to sleep now." But we just kept playing and kept playing and kept going and it just it just was it time would just stop. You would play the game and you would just be so immersed in it and it would just move you forward and it was fun. So, that was a good game. , I remember we

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=295s" target="_blank">4:55</a> Also had a Commodore 64 when I was really really little. And I think there was one called George of the Jungle, I believe. George of the Jungle. And you would like this little character and you had to like these ropes were swinging and you had to like jump to catch the rope to go across the alligator and then catch the next. All those Comm 64 games though were like extremely difficult. I remember very hard. , but I think I probably spent the most time on Super Mario Brothers. like it was it was the Super Mario stuff. And then from the Sega Genesis realm, it was all about the Sonic. So, I did a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=329s" target="_blank">5:29</a> Lot of Sonic. Sonic a lot. So, and those are all the classics for the console. So, yeah. You ever play those like Starcraft, the Blizzard games? I did. I I think I played World of Warcraft, the early versions or or Warcraft in general. Those ones I really like, the Orc ones, the very early Yes. Yes. Yes. Classic. I really like those. the newer ones that they've done with World of Warcraft, not as good. And the the World of Warcraft like 3D Realm where you go in your character, you're playing this. I think it's really interesting.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=361s" target="_blank">6:01</a> I just don't feel like I have the time to like put hundreds if not thousands of hours into this game and character and stuff. That's the crazy thing. That's the crazy thing right now. That's not my style. I would like some retro games to be built like around more of that early day Warcraft, early day Starcraft, , build a base. And there's something, maybe you had this too, Tommy, but I like the games that where I could like build a bunch of resources and it was like on that edge of like it's a little

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=393s" target="_blank">6:33</a> Bit almost a bit too difficult, but like if you just were patient and built enough things, you could like overwhelm the enemy and just build like a monstrosity or out like, what ? Like you could almost like get to a point where like, okay, I got to be patient. I got to defend. I got to keep things together. And at some point you get to a point where you're so powerful you're like, "Okay, now I can just go demolish the the enemy." Right? That I love that feeling. I love that feeling of being able to like stockpile, collect, grow, build, and at some point you were like large enough you're like, "Okay, I'm just going to send the bombers over and we're just going to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=424s" target="_blank">7:04</a> Just bomb the side of their base and they can't do anything about it." Like that's you're like, I ain't going to fight. I'm going to annihilate. Yeah, he's exactly right. So, I liked I liked getting to that point in those games and I feel like a lot of the , Starcraft Command and Conquer was another one that I really liked. Command and Conquer was another one of those and it was good for like the first couple beginning levels and then it continually got progressively harder and harder and harder. I'm like, I don't want that. I just want bigger maps. I want more things to demolish. I want to be able to like just come in and just obliterate stuff. More level ups. Yeah. I want a thousand

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=456s" target="_blank">7:36</a> Sergs coming at you thing. So I and I loved Starcraft. Starcraft was a great game until I started playing online and like that I never was an online player because I never understood how people could be so good at a game and I wasn't willing to devote my life to this. We would play like a game of Starcraft like all right I'm going to do my annihilation and like two minutes people are attacking me and I'm gone. I'm like how how' they get that? How did you do that? Yeah. How did they do that? So what I used to play a lot? The Sims. Do you ever play that? I did play the Sims, but not very long.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=490s" target="_blank">8:10</a> It was not a very lengthy time for me to play the Sims. That one was interesting. , I just didn't feel like it had much of a goal. I didn't like I was like I wanted like more a bit of a more of an Again, I'm coming from all the the strategy games like dominate, destroy the base, like all these like very like and you get to the Sims, you're like go out to the bar, go to the bathroom. Yeah, exactly. Clean up the living room and like this is stuff I do already at home. I don't I don't want to do this in a game. Doesn't seem doesn't seem as effective

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=522s" target="_blank">8:42</a> For me. Yeah. But no, give me a simple game that I can master or it still takes a little time to like I don't have to have 18 manuals. It does take some patience to learn. That's a game I like. I don't need like well you're going to have to like sell your liver if you want to be good at this or s not see your children. And that's exactly what backyard baseball was. It was a perfect simple game with a tournament and a season. What was the early There was like a football game like a blitz John Madden or NFL Blitz NFL Blitz that was just well

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=554s" target="_blank">9:14</a> I didn't have that game but my friends had that one and that was one that was like you would like body slam people and like it was like in crazy like it was like WWE meets football thing. Oh and there cheat codes I can still tell you it was 4A 1B 5Z for unlimited turbo. There you go. that right before the game loads and then you can have as much turbo as you want. I think that was right. Yeah. So, anyways, fun times. So, let's just as we're doing this back on , we talked about our early childhood games.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=586s" target="_blank">9:46</a> I'd be curious, Tommy, if you fast forwarded into college age. Mhm. What was your game around college? Do you remember like the college was there was there a game or console thing that you did in college? It was all multiplayer and at that point it was all like since I lived with a bunch of guys so it was like FIFA. It was FIFA and we didn't really And that's a game that will test friendship. If anyone has ever played that like if you want to see how close you are to friends, the amount of the amount of controllers I broke and do after would score is because they were wired controllers

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=618s" target="_blank">10:18</a> And he would just dangle it in front of me after he scored and just like make a face thing. And to this day, as much as he's my best man, I still hate him for that. Like I still like I still have just this hatred, this anger, this seething in me thinking about it. That's hilarious. That's funny. What about you? Did you have a game? I did. I think in college I consumed way too much Halo and I was very focused on Halo. Classic. Yeah. So I I remember getting and that was like on the early Xbox. I had like the very first Xbox that came out. That

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=651s" target="_blank">10:51</a> Was the original Halo and then they did like Halo 2 and Halo 3 and it be kept becoming like this sequence of games. I remember just being so motivated to get the next game as soon as it came out. Would get the game, go find it, bring it back home. We'd play it and I would continue on the story. So that was that was a really fun game as well. Any any games? So let's just fast forward to where you are today. Do you play any games at all today? I I wish so. I wish I could go back to the RG strategy games. There's the Jurassic Park one that looks amazing, but it's the time. Like I I I I I'll

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=685s" target="_blank">11:25</a> Play Nintendo with the kids because those are actually pretty dang fun. Like they have the old You can play the old N64 games. So like Zelda Orina of Orina of Time, Zelda 64. But I the thing is it's the time investment. I I wish to this day my my parents limited how much I played because I play too much. I think I play too much and I think I would be such a better consultant, a better person if I didn't play as much as I did. especially the N64. So there's not a lot of games right now.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=717s" target="_blank">11:57</a> Right now it's all like with with the family. I'm trying to get my wife to like just play me in Mario Kart. That's like part of me is like so I could beat you, but like just play me in Mario Kart for a little. But nothing right now. Do you have time because or is it the Legos? I feel like that would take up that's the strategic side for you to get that that side of the brain. Legos I think come out more around the holidays for me. That's like when I do all the technic sets and collect those things. what I've been more recently into is we I've been finding a lot of like space adventure games. so one of them has

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=750s" target="_blank">12:30</a> Been Astanineir, which is one that's on my Xbox and PC. And this is one where I've been able to get the kids involved with it. And then the other one that's about more creative building, adventuring a little bit is Minecraft as well. So we've been doing some Minecraft with the kids, which my son when I introduced him to it, he was like all into it. And so we still do that a little bit. he has a Nintendo Switch and so he he got into like the Zelda series. I I showed him those and the new games of Zelda are just incredible. Like it's it's nothing like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=782s" target="_blank">13:02</a> You remember playing on the original Nintendo, but it that one is super fun. I find that I move myself more towards games that are more adventure explor exploring discovering things. , and then also I do a lot less multiplayer games. I do a lot more like one player or like local collaborative games like working together collaboratively to like build something or create things or go explore things. I feel like those are much more interesting and I can play at my skill level as opposed to like what you were

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=813s" target="_blank">13:33</a> Saying like I couldn't do like Call of Duty anymore. Like there's just no point. Yeah. Two minutes. I'd have to be playing like, , the babies on the game because I'm just not good. And it would it it gets so frustrating and I just like I just don't enjoy the game when I'm dying so quickly and I don't want to spend the time to become good at it. I just want something that's like a leisurely playable game that's at my level, but I don't need to be at like ultra mega good levels. Two games I wish I played. One I would never play because I'm too scared of it, but it sounded intriguing. The other one

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=844s" target="_blank">14:04</a> I don't have enough time. One was it was called Alien Survivor and it was the Alien series, but the the the the whole hook of it was the alien learned from you on how you hid and like you you die, , you die, but it would learn your tactics and then adapt to that, which I thought was pretty cool, but I'm too scared of that stuff. Jump scares can't do it. N the other one was this space game that every planet was generated in time which I always thought was really neat and I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=875s" target="_blank">14:35</a> Tried playing that but like every planet was weird but the idea of that was incredible. Like this whole the infinite universe everything is computationally generated in time. So all the planets you go to the people who made it never created that planet. Yep. And it's a full planet. This is No Man's Sky. Yes. Yes. That's the name of it. Yeah. So, I have that game. That's one of my space adventure games that I've gotten into. Yes. And I just started it with my son. So, I played it a while ago. got

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=907s" target="_blank">15:07</a> Into it a little bit. It was fun. Super fun. Enjoyed it. My son just and I just got back into it and we're now playing it again together. So, I can start the world. He can show up and then we can adventure around together. Updated. Yeah, it's it's a it's a good game. I like that. That one's another one. A monthly series on No Man's Sky because I want to hear your updates on that. We'll be playing it a little bit more recently. the other game that I have discovered that I haven't played yet is called Outer Wilds. Apparently, it's a really fun game and the story is just very wellcraftrafted. It got a lot of awards. That's another space

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=939s" target="_blank">15:39</a> Adventure game that you it's it's like you're stuck in a time loop. So, you're like in this time loop where you can go I think it's like 22 minutes or 22 hours. Like it's a it's a cycle. you have to explore and figure out why the time keeps looping, but you only have like a certain amount of time to go discover it and then you have to like reset and go back over again. But like you you get to a point and like it resets and you start over. interesting. So, another a fun really well-ritten story game. So, those are the things I'm looking for. I like it. I will say this, Tommy, I was googling Backyard Baseball because I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=972s" target="_blank">16:12</a> Never played that one. Yeah. Apparently, you can go get that game for $10 on Steam. You can still play it. Oh, I would. It has to be the original though because they made a lot of different versions of it. This is Backyard Baseball 97. I think that that might be it. Okay, let me take a look at this Backyard Baseball. You might , again, it's easy to sign up for Steam. You may want to check it out. But it seems like this is the game that you're looking for. And it would even support your Xbox controllers through your home computer. You might want to check that one out.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1004s" target="_blank">16:44</a> Oh, you don't even need a controller. Oh my gosh. That's it. Is that it? That's it. Yep. I I can still play in my head. I still have the There goes your day. I just ruined your day for you. Yeah, it it's great game. Great game. Great game. So, well, maybe I'll have to get it and we'll have to like, , comment. we that one we could play online. That would be fun to play online. The the re the recent reviews, all reviews is overwhelmingly positive and the recent reviews is very positive. Like, so yeah. again. Pablo, the secret weapon. I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1036s" target="_blank">17:16</a> Exactly. I'm just saying it's a it's available. You might be able to go get All right. Well, I guess I'm not I'm going to tell my wife I'm doing something else today, but I'm going to be very busy. There you go. Boom. I'm in meetings all day. Anyways, that should be super fun. Anyways, let's move over to our our main top. So, our main topic today, Tommy, you want to introduce us to our main topic and then we'll go through our mailbag. It is a mailbag and it is a retort from someone about our conversations around subscriptions. Surprisingly, Mike, a lot of our mailbag

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1070s" target="_blank">17:50</a> Inquiries that we get are around subscriptions. We we've actually done more than I thought we would, especially in the last 100, excuse me, last 100 episodes. So, very intriguing. So, I'm going to go ahead and just read this and then I think we'll go from there. And there is no name on here, which again, leave your name. We'll give a shout out to you. Even if we don't know who you are, we'll say your name, but we want to know who you are because we really do appreciate you guys sending out a mailbag. Again, powerbi.tipsodcast. You can leave any mailbag you want and we'll probably talk about it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1103s" target="_blank">18:23</a> And here we go. While I'm sympathetic to Mike's defense of the PowerBI platform to draw people into analysis and research, I lean empathetic when it comes to getting actionable insights into the hands of professionals who may not always need to be digging into PowerBI reports. Here's a use case where the email subscription has been proven useful. We have a sales tool that contains the names of professionals you would want to contact to advance a sale periodically. And I love the wording here. this guy is clearly or this person's clearly a smart person. Those

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1137s" target="_blank">18:57</a> It's not me. GBT or something or GBT, right? Yeah. Touche. Those people leave the company, but the data source that records that departure is not directly accessible in the sales tool. I built a simple little report that compares the data in the sales tool with a data source with departure information. If the name in the sales tool pops up as departures, the report shows a big red number counting the number of departures. There are about a dozen different people who are responsible for updating the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1169s" target="_blank">19:29</a> Sales tool one if one of their contacts changes. I set up an automated email subscription that sends them this report every Monday morning showing the count of contacts who needs to be updated as none if there were no departures. The email shows the page with a metric and a list of departed names, if any, plus a link to the report. The report itself contains links and instructions if you need to update a name. Dead easy. You either see a red number or none, and whether you need to look deeper. This one little tool probably saves

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1202s" target="_blank">20:02</a> Hours each week and is a reassuring reminder of our contacts are clean each week. and Mike, this levels the playing ground or I think this provides a really good discussion for us because our background on this topic and again we've talked about this a lot because you guys have been sending in some great questions around this is it's great email subscriptions had a place but generally we want to bring people to the reports and that's been our general consensus around email subscriptions but now this person brings a really good use case here and I'm gonna hand it over to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1237s" target="_blank">20:37</a> Do does this on at least from the onset your initial thoughts your initial reaction. How does that make you feel? Does it make you feel a little differently about your subscriptions or how we treat subscriptions? Yeah, I I think this conversation can go many one of many different ways. I'm going to take I'm I'm going to address maybe this mailbag question first and then maybe we can take it a couple different directions off of this. Right. When I look at emailed things, usually it's around I need data to be people are asking for, hey, look, I'm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1270s" target="_blank">21:10</a> I'm always in my email. I want it to just show up in my email. I need the Excel file, the CSV file because I'm collecting this data on my own somewhere else and doing something with it. Understand? Like I I I understand the use case. I just disagree with it. And so let let me let me unpack. So let let me address this particular mailbag question directly. Right? What when I this is my mind when I look at this I go what is the core issue here? The core issue is people are departing and the report is not showing that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1306s" target="_blank">21:46</a> Right. So the so the issue is one of the systems is not correctly doing the updates. Now, this is probably because there's a sales system with sales representatives linking to customers, right? And so what we're doing is we're just updating things, right? This person has left the organization. They're no longer with us. Therefore, I have to go in and for these customers remove that person. This this whole system to me, what everything that's set up here is a workaround for a a system that's not built properly. It's it's it's a system that doesn't it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1338s" target="_blank">22:18</a> Doesn't talk to each other correctly, right? If someone leaves, there should be something automated in a way that says this person's leaving. There should be a task that's kicked off. Like these what this is doing. This is this is building a again I'm not faulting this. This is this is not a fault. All I'm saying is as an outsider looking at the at observationally at this solution. I'm looking at it and going, you have built a process that involves emailing people reports on Monday because something internal to your organization does not communicate. Am I wrong?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1372s" target="_blank">22:52</a> I don't think I'm wrong here. Like the the issue is internally their system does not update correctly. Therefore, we're building a separate process to fix the solution. Not a problem. Now, let me just pause there. No. Yeah. And I'm just going to get good real quick. , philosophically speaking, you're right. From a from a very high point of view, a bird's eye view, you're right. There nothing you said would be I would say is erroneous or I would disagree with. However, you and I both know more than

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1406s" target="_blank">23:26</a> Anyone that's not how the real world works. And especially when you're dealing, it's not just here that these two things are not communicating with each other. It's also people being responsible for their own contacts. We already are at least proven based on the message that one, this is already saving a ton of time. Now, if you went into here, would your first thing be, okay, we're going to make these two tech, , two technologies talk to each other. Boom, done. But to me, that's not I think that's missing the point. Yes and no. I'm going to I'm going to at

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1438s" target="_blank">23:58</a> Least ask the question, right? So, again, I'm looking at this from an outsers's perspective, right? There's a re there's a reason this thing is stood up. Someone is not letting someone have access to something. There's a problem. There's there's something broken in the process that's not letting it just to happen. Right? So, would I look at this and go two systems just can't talk to each other? That could be an IT policy. That could be that's just the way it's not set up. The system that that the sales people could be in could be legacy and really old and not working right. There could be a number of different factors as to why these two systems can't talk to each other. But at the end

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1469s" target="_blank">24:29</a> Of the day, I'm looking at this going like, okay, this is one of the reasons why fabric exists. And now when I look at things like translitical task flows, this is another area where I'm like, what, I understand I understand the purpose of printing the report here. But I would argue is my argument would come back and say okay knowing that knowing that we have this system that doesn't necessarily correct together. Fabric is trying to address those kinds of solutions by actually making you have like the user data functions that can do that stuff

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1504s" target="_blank">25:04</a> Like what would so I would go back and ask the question what can we do to enable these things to talk to each other. What would it it might even be better to have when something in the system detects there's a problem on a refresh of a data set automatically having at the end of that refresh of the semantic model run a UDF go into the data system look for the mismatched users go pull data from other systems because the the user data function can do all those things it can access any system at all so I'm looking

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1537s" target="_blank">25:37</a> At this going the the capabilities of fabric extends more than just like a semantic model report. Now, let me just also pause here as well. I'm thinking immediately in the world of fabric. This user may be in a world of just PowerBI and that also limits you a bit more there as well. So like if you're in the world of PowerBI and like I can see it and I understand let me say this way I have empathy for the situation. I would just push for a a second set of eyes to step back and say how can we solve this in a more

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1571s" target="_blank">26:11</a> Automated way. So you're what are you try and my question is what I'm trying to rack my brain is what are you trying to solve here? Because to me the problem solved because there are three aspects here that we always think about and it's not just the technology and I think fabric to your point would solve it but it's the people and the process here. To me what this is doing so eloquently where I'm going to be on the other side of this argument here is you have people owning the process and owning their contacts in a way that maybe they wouldn't otherwise. So yeah, maybe a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1604s" target="_blank">26:44</a> Technology can solve this, but that might not be solving the problem here. And you you said we're trying to solve a problem. Well, what's the problem? Is it just the technologies not talking to each other? To me, it's making sure that people are responsible if people are departed or whatever that case is their status and making sure that the sales rep or those sales operation people are ensuring that that occurs. They may not have the technology that's knows what that status is unless that contact's actually doing it. There may not be the technology gap, but what we're actually doing here and where I encourage and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1638s" target="_blank">27:18</a> Where I would if I was the data ZAR at this company and I'm gonna push for this 100% is the fact that you sales rep are owning your contacts and you have no excuse now every Monday to see what's going on with your sales with your accounts and your people or whoever that person is. I would rather in any world, in any planet, on any company, make sure that people are aware of what they own and have accountability for that and have action to do it than technologies just solve it. Especially if there's not 18,000 Excel files here. So, for me, I'm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1673s" target="_blank">27:53</a> Looking at this in a different lens maybe because I I don't I don't necessarily disagree with you when it comes to the technology part of this where I would disagree on where's the problem. And again, for me, I look at this and I see that, what? Wow, people are owning and they're aware of what they own. And it sounds like everyone's gung-ho and knows the expectation here. That's the point of PowerBI. That's the point of what we do. It's not just a technology problem that we deal with. So, I look at this and I say, "This is phenomenal,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1708s" target="_blank">28:28</a> But why email it?" Okay, let's deal with that. So I this is a good No, no, this is good. This is good. But why? But again, I'm going back to like I understand it's a process. And for all intents and purposes, why isn't this report live every day? what? So, , I look at the process and I go, but why the email? Why is email need to be involved in any of this for that matter? So, I look at this going thinking, okay, I set up an automated email subscription. It sends out every Monday. My guess is this happens so infrequently

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1741s" target="_blank">29:01</a> That it's not that big a deal and that way Mondays are the right cadence to do this in fine but with the event of like we're working in teams we're working in outlook you can go to outlook and you can have a powerbi report button on the right hand side of the screen so again my argument would be is all what is the what is the right trigger signal mo notification element that says you need to go do something right and I think I think the the the email subscriptions is a way of forcing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1774s" target="_blank">29:34</a> Someone to become okay here's but again just going back to like I I have so much noise in my email box already I don't want another email so here's how I'm going to take this right let's say someone send starts sending me reports every Monday and it goes what I'm going to do is going to be like look this is cluttering up my inbox I'm going to set up a rule in my inbox and it's going to filter all those emails into a single folder I'm going to let those folders pile up and I'm just going to go every so often go look at that folder and go find those items in that folder and even now today that's what I do with my email to me is just

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1807s" target="_blank">30:07</a> Not a responsive realtime thing. What I think I would like to see would be an alert that's actually coming more, , when the semantic model refreshes and we find that this person no longer exists or there's someone missing or someone has been deleted from a system, whatever that may be. Anytime there's someone like missing, I would expect it to send me a message in Teams is go fix this. This is we just we were did the refresh this morning. Go fix it. And so why does it have to be every Monday? Do people not leave during the middle of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1839s" target="_blank">30:39</a> The week? Do we not care if the sales representative leaves on a Thursday and we have a Friday of time where they're not attached to anything? I don't know if that's important to them. It sounds like the speed of their business is once a week is good enough, but that also might be like not good enough and there could be other reasons to have this on real time. Back to your point, Tommy, right? It goes back to what we're measuring, right? the what what is important on the the team that's managing these contacts, right? If this is data that they're expected to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1872s" target="_blank">31:12</a> Manage, yes, fine. Send them like but it just to me it just feels like such a like a a waste of things. Now in this situation it's actual reports that are getting emailed out. I understand this one. The other one I have a lot of another use case that I have a lot of hard time with is send me the Excel file, send me the table of data every Monday on this stuff. And that way and then when you take that out and go do a bunch of more analysis with it, that's also something I'm like gosh this doesn't seem efficient. I should just give you the semantic model and let you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1903s" target="_blank">31:43</a> See the data. Anyways, just no no that's a good point. This isn't not and for me for once this is not that Excel file situation and I agree with but again let's put ourselves and you've worked with sales people too. I I my first two gigs were devoted to the sales team and the sales department. So what they would rather have play that ring sound that we've been doing when we have guests because they would rather a phone call with their data than they would an email. But they live these people live on Outlook. And again, it's as much as I've talked

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1937s" target="_blank">32:17</a> About when we've talked about adoption, I want to bring people to the platform. I want to bring people the data culture, right? We talk about that all the time. There's also that situation too, unfortunately, where you got to meet people where they're at. And for a lot of these people, especially sales reps, they probably live in email. Now, does that make this does that excuse this? Maybe. actually potentially will change anywhere like and do like do you want them to live in email like the my other argument so email is nice because you can talk to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=1970s" target="_blank">32:50</a> Anyone anywhere just as long as you have the address you can then communicate with them right but then I'd also argue like is that the right medium on which we're going to talk to our customers will that be the medium moving forward in the next wave of sales teams yeah what would a sales manager say are they meeting their quota great then that works well I look at it a lot now like I interact most with my customers and if you want my response or a quicker response on things it's teams and so most of my customers I try and wire up teams and I can directly talk to their teams and they can talk directly to me and my teams and if I can't do it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2003s" target="_blank">33:23</a> Initially when we're on boarding or getting set up we typically have them add our organization now again I granted that doesn't happen in all situations with you yeah doesn't happen everywhere but I find me personally I think there's a new wave of employees coming in into the world here that are going to be like less motivated around email, they're going to be more motivated around, , teams chatting, real-time interactions, like applications that are like communicating directly with your customers. Well, and let's dive into that a little more actually because honestly the new you want to talk about the new wave of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2034s" target="_blank">33:54</a> People their email that they're looking at is not even on their computer and this is I think the trend that we're going into the two trends that I see is the device that people are preferred to look at email communicate and what they're doing on those devices it's their phone one of my my sister's cousin who's a big sales rep does a lot of sells actually meet to different places in Chicago sales teams are always on their phone. He's like seven hours out of the day I'm on my phone. The other hour I'm on my computer because I have to be. But the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2066s" target="_blank">34:26</a> Seven hours when I'm talking to people, it's on his phone. So, and yeah, you can put install PowerBI on the device. But let's let's be honest right now. Let's be honest. Unless you're building mobile devoted reports and not the mobile version of the report. I'm talking about what you've done before a little bit wider, a little bit narrower screen, maybe a bit longer. It's not the it's not the mobile thing. It's literally I can create the page that way. It's not the best. It's not the ideal experience. It will show your data. But again, my goal at the end of the day, at

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2099s" target="_blank">34:59</a> The end of the day, if I'm a data analyst, a data a business intelligence director or a consultant, my goal for an organization is to deliver and to make sure that the data is actionable from top down in whatever capacity that is. And if I'm trying to bring people to PowerBI for the sake of bringing them to PowerBI, I think I'm missing the mark. Now, the numbers look great if we have our usage analytics because, oh, look at all these people, the increase of numbers into the platform. But if I'm if these people are immediately acting and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2132s" target="_blank">35:32</a> We know we're saving time, we've already done the use case that we're saving time here. For me, I'm I have achieved my goal, especially for these sales reps. Now we can have a conversation on what can be more what can we expedite or be more efficient in this process would you rather power app or an application that rather than going to the report but my goal is however the data is coming in whatever that mediums in that the people are responsible and own what they own and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2165s" target="_blank">36:05</a> Can act on what they should act on and for me the email is a great medium and now and I say this when I again don't edit this part and put that in a short email is a great medium because Oh, I'm definitely editing. Yeah, I know. Tommy says, "Leave PowerBI." New news flash. News flash. Yeah, I know. YouTube says, "Leave PowerBI. Go back to email. It's the only way to work do your work nowadays. So much more efficient." Yeah. But , I've had even come back to Outlook, my friend, because let's be honest, nine out of 10en times email subscriptions are probably not the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2199s" target="_blank">36:39</a> Way. But let's also look on the other side of the coin. We still see emails or blog articles and documentation from Microsoft investing in subscriptions. Do why? Because this is still part of the process. Just like Excel is going to exist, data and information and Outlook's going to exist. I've always said when I worked with companies like my goal is the first thing people do in the morning is they check their email and they check the letters and the order that they're in to help them direct what

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2232s" target="_blank">37:12</a> They're going to do a sentence. The next thing they're going to do they're going to check PowerBI and the next they're going to check the the order those numbers are in and that's going to cause them to do their second action. That should be the goal of every person working in business intelligence. At the end of the day, I'm going to disagree with you right there. Not email. Email is not the first place you look. Well, really, I'm gonna argue email is not my calendar is the first place I look. , I even now and calendar are the first things I look. I go to teams and make sure there's no messages there. I almost

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2264s" target="_blank">37:44</a> Don't , there'll be times I don't touch my email until like noon. I've been burnt by that listening. Yeah, but that's just how I work. , that's how I , mo again going back to like where are my immediate issues? where are the things I need to be talking to? Like I'm leading teams of people and we're all on team. So I think I understand your comment there, but more and more my medium I less and less prefer email. I prefer more and more other things, right? So I I'm going to disagree with you on that point. I don't think fine.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2295s" target="_blank">38:15</a> I think that's just Yeah, I'm just going to say I think email starting your day in email is probably a good thing for most people because that's the main thing that most people have access or or information to. But I think this is beginning to change and I think messaging is becoming the first place people need to land and then they're going to email when they want. I think regardless of the situation and yes, I know PowerBI is an app in Teams and I'm aware of that. But again, this is part of like we have to dumb things down and at the end as frustrating as this is for me to say

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2327s" target="_blank">38:47</a> Because I hate saying this because it's almost like it's almost like giving up a little. It's almost too hard for people to say, , just click on the PowerBI icon, go to this report when they're in the thread or when they're in their inbox thing. Like I know it sounds so dumb to say just or so simple to just click on that PowerBI app. It's right there. We've developed the channel, , the the tab. It's right there. It's so easy. But people don't think like that. There's a lot of people still and they're going to be always people who are technology adverse

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2360s" target="_blank">39:20</a> Because the technology is always changing quicker. So to me whether you're sending a message in teams that has your PowerBI report or it's an email message in your inbox, whichever medium you want to put it in, people are can be technology adverse and sometimes we have to meet those talented people where they're at with technology because these are these are talented people. And Mike, I hate saying this. I I want to make sure that I'm emphasizing it's it's unfortunate that I even have to say this because I you think most people if

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2393s" target="_blank">39:53</a> You're talented you should adapt with technology but that's not the case and I that's been the experience I've seen over and over again whatever the technology was right and I'm not just talking about today in 200 whatever 25 I'm saying this when it was 2015 when I started how people people who were meant to be anal didn't know how to work in Excel and didn't like it and that's just the way it was and yeah you can say what you want about the type of employee we are but this is the people side of it this is the people side of the people process

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2426s" target="_blank">40:26</a> Technology and you can say that we can just dismiss them you and I can but a lot of employees can't because these people probably provide some valuable contribution so I know this is a bit subjective here and I know we just want to dismiss these people as not getting with it. But there's also a hard argument here, Mike, that you can't argue that this is not the case everywhere. Yeah. So, let let me let me retool a bit more of the question here. What's going

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2458s" target="_blank">40:58</a> On here, right? So, I'm I'm going to make a couple assumptions and then I'm going to start from those assumptions. I'm going to assume that this sales team, whoever they may be, it says there's about a dozen people who are responsible for updating the sales tool if things change, right? , in again I'm going to go back to why would I slow down my process to every Monday as opposed to just building the report and telling people to go there or sending them an email and pushing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2493s" target="_blank">41:33</a> Them to the report. Like the subscription's fine, but I wouldn't I don't maybe I'm maybe I'm thinking about things two differently ways, right? So I'm looking at this going I feel like there's some eventdriven notifications that should be sent out here as opposed to this. So at the end of the day regardless what happens here we have metric sets we have things that can be notified people can be notified when something changes in the data set or semantic model. So that to me a better way of looking at this problem should be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2527s" target="_blank">42:07</a> On whatever sales dashboard I have whatever that may be right my assumption is what is the report that these people are working out off of every single day my sales report my revenue report whatever every I guarantee you there's a handful of reports that are being used every single day by teams in order to make sure that we're meeting our sales quota our objectives those things as That's where I'd be putting this information, right? I'm I'm not looking at this trying to build a separate process that is emailing people a file,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2559s" target="_blank">42:39</a> A form, all the instructions, everything that's described here, right? Yeah. I have an automated subscription that sends them this report every Monday. Great. I don't like that. I'd rather be what I'd rather have is I'd rather have here are the reports that we have already today or here are the apps that we already have today. I'm going to build a single report that lives inside that app. And that way whenever we go in there, the homepage of every app that people interact with has the health status, right? There's a health status area and there is u it gives

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2592s" target="_blank">43:12</a> Them the number. There are no outdated there are no disjointed records between the contacts and the people who have departed for sales. Great. Move on. You you the status dashboard has the information. You can move on. When there is a status issue, you make the red button, warning, update records required, and you click that card. It takes you to the page again, has the instructions on it, has the links. All this can live in a real time report. And you just put this report closer to where people are doing their work. And so to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2625s" target="_blank">43:45</a> Me, instead of emailing people stuff, you should incorporate these things in an app whatever you're distributing to these customers. And that should be just part of the solution to me. That makes the most sense. And yeah, because now it's real time. I don't need to send out emails. And if you feel like you need notifications, go use metric sets that say we should have zero mismatched accounts. And anytime there's not a mismatched

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2658s" target="_blank">44:18</a> Account, send an email. So every time the data set refreshes, it's checking to see if that number is zero. And if it doesn't, then send out the email and say, "Hey, there's a mismatch. Here's the link to the report." Click the link to the report. It takes you into the report. You may go there. Mike, I love where you're going with this because this is where I'm going to align with you. And I I'm I'm going to contradict probably what I just said. However, you're talking about a theory, an economic theory. Actually, one of my favorite books I' ever read is called Nudge by Richard Taylor.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2690s" target="_blank">44:50</a> You've talked about this a number of times already. I got to read this. You've said it multiple times. Mike, you would you would love this. Instead of us playing video games, I think books will are probably that's the age we're at now probably. But I'll get I'll get like a a podcast or something. I can I can listen to being read to me like when I go on a long trip. Seriously, read the ebook or or or read the or listen to the audible of it. But the idea here and what you're going to what you're speaking to is exactly how I would change people's behaviors. And I so I love what you're saying here.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2723s" target="_blank">45:23</a> And just a background on the book, Nudge, they did a study and they realized that all these kids in a elementary school were eating a bunch of desserts. So this guy came in, he's like, "Well, we're just changing where the desserts are." And all they did was simply move. They didn't tell PE the kids what to do, but they just changed where the salad bar is and where the dessert bar was when people walked in. And immediately from stat, they saw the uptick on kids not taking as much of the cookies and they were taking more of the vegetables and that's where the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2755s" target="_blank">45:55</a> Inventory was going just by changing things around. So Mike, this is or this is exactly where I think I'm going to lean with you here. The email is can be a great behavior, but if like but we have all this other technology and we can make this even more efficient with a minimal cost. Yes. Which this is where I lean with you. It's like yeah it is. Is it efficient now? Now, great. Can it be more? Absolutely. And there's it's easy. It should be easy enough to say, "Hey, on October 1st, we are no longer sending

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2788s" target="_blank">46:28</a> The email subscription. Bookmark this link. It's a bookmark. If you can't do that, you probably shouldn't have a job." And that's where I'll be a little, , like seriously, not even not even that. I would even give them the friction of making a bookmark. I, to your point, Tommy, I would put this in every single thing else that we're delivering, right? So I'm hoping again this is my assumption when I'm rolling out reports to a sales team typically I'm giving out apps typically I'm giving links to reports I'm sharing things through a workspace however it is yeah and that works in power powerbi it also works inside fabric and so even in the powerbi realm I have the ability of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2823s" target="_blank">47:03</a> Metric sets I have the the ability of having KPIs there and then I can set up a semantic model that has the checks that I need and and then when this item hits an alert I can then immediately on refresh the semantic model, send out the alert. The alert emails the people you need and says go to this report. And again, my landing position of everything we're doing here is not a printed report that we're emailing to people. I think it's a waste I think it's a waste of time. I think it's a waste on your email server. It just takes up space and then

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2857s" target="_blank">47:37</a> People have to delete them or they put them somewhere else. And which one is there like there's no to me there's no valid reason why you need to be emailing people data because as soon as you email them data that data becomes stale. It's not real anymore. It's not active. And so I there's just there's just so many things that I'm like it creates friction I think you don't want to have. Now, I don't want to bring this up, but I I agree with that to a point, but then in back of my head, I'm like, well, go tell Jamie Diamond that because he still

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2889s" target="_blank">48:09</a> Prefers the printed out reports, and this guy has done a great job at Chase. Yes. Up until this point, but like is that is that , let's go call let's call Jamie our ourselves, me and you and me. Who who are the who are the financial markets clamoring for now? They're now clamoring after new technologies. are now clamoring off of cryptocurrencies. The world's changing very quickly now and and bank the banking industry the crypto industry is now getting a big push for all this digital space. I I'm convinced like Tommy these banks

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2923s" target="_blank">48:43</a> Are around but like they're not they've been around and they've been doing well the way they whether or not you want it on a printed report and that's just preference at this point or you want it digitally. At the end of the day what's really happening is there are four or five key metrics they're looking at. They need them consolidated down to a single something to go do their whether it's on a medium of digital things or not digital things does not matter. I will bet you a stake on the choice of your currency. Like I I don't think I don't I don't really think yes banks but banks

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2959s" target="_blank">49:19</a> Are probably one of the slowest most backwards companies I've ever worked with. They are on old technology. They're running old servers. Everything's on prem. They're not willing to go to the cloud. Like if anything is ripe for change and again security has to be paramount. It's banking industry like and so to me this is like that is the most backwards industry I've been I've been in or experienced because I'm like they they're so so riskadverse. They just and that's why banks cost so much money. And I think this is also one of the industries that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=2992s" target="_blank">49:52</a> Is going to be ripe for disruption here in the near future because cryptocurrencies don't need all that infrastructure. Cryptocurrencies are built on like a public ledger. Cryptocurrencies are built on this new. So there's a whole new world of financial stuff evolving here and they're not even touching it yet. So yeah, I wouldn't even use and I'm not trying to like discredit Jamie Diamond and Chase and the banking industry in general, but I'm just saying of the things that I'm looking for that's forward thinking. I'm not thinking that direction. I'm looking at more like modern solutions. And I think we're just going to I think I me personally I'm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3026s" target="_blank">50:26</a> Going to just push for real time actionable data and how do I present it back in my existing reports instead of emailing things. Listen, with the bank thing, the reason I jumped into consulting because when I heard some stories, I'm like, I'll have a job forever. Multinational banks are dealing with this and the stories are but the sit this the point was there are companies still deal with this. But I want to get back to your point because I think that was a little too a little a little too far left so to speak. But I think the idea here, Mike, is and where I'm leaning with you is can we change

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3058s" target="_blank">50:58</a> People's behaviors just because they enjoy something and they're used to something. Again, I don't want to do something for the sake of just because it should be done, right? Like, if we're going to make this push to getting people off of email subscription and getting people off of what we're doing, well, then it has to be a better experience and it has to provide better value than it does now. Otherwise, I'm not going to do it. Now, that being said, there are multiple cases and the excuses that even I said at the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3091s" target="_blank">51:31</a> Beginning about, well, , these sales people, they're used to phone calls and email. Great. Well, they're used to a browser, too, and they use the web and laptop, right? But that's that's looking at your sales team the way it is today. Exactly. Are we going to assume that all of our, , , Jenzers or whatever are whatever the age group that is that sales team, right? Is that going to continue to be having the same thing? Oh, you're never going to hire a new younger salesperson. Are they going to expect different technologies? , is it is it getting easier for me to build these things? I This is where I'm going to like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3124s" target="_blank">52:04</a> Challenge a little bit here and say, "Look, things are going to be changing. It's going to be shifting." And I would always encourage a business to I think I think in Let me just step back real quick. big picture in general if you don't push your team to move on to more modern tech pieces modern ways of thinking modern pieces I think you are that department or that team is almost a little bit of a detriment like some people just need to move on some

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3157s" target="_blank">52:37</a> People will be able to learn and adapt but to say that your team can't learn a power report or a couple different clicks or a different interaction a different process I think is a very poor way of looking at your team. I I really want to encourage any teams that I'm working with to be like continually learning. We're going to be adapting. The only thing that is consistent is change. And so if you're going to go come into a job and a role and think you're going to learn this one thing and you're going to just stay there and never change a thing,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3188s" target="_blank">53:08</a> I'm I'm going to argue like that's already a crippling mindset. Yeah. just just the mental thinking, the mindset in that department is already putting you at a disadvantage. Yeah, we don't live in the world of IBM anymore where you stay anywhere for 50 years and you're doing the same thing. But no, but to your point also and let's make an assumption too. You you you there are a few assumptions you made, but I'm going to make one as well. This is not the only data the sales team has or obviously this company has. And I guarantee you to your point,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3221s" target="_blank">53:41</a> This may be a great example, but I guarantee you there's a lot of other barriers that team has to either act or own their data. And I won't even say the word insights here, just act and own. To your point, if we can not only build this within an app or a centralized place, but build this in a place with the other data that they have to act and own on, we will be more efficient. So it's there's the point. So that to me it's like if we're looking at just the PowerBI realm, right? Data flows, incremental refreshes,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3254s" target="_blank">54:14</a> Semantic models, and metric sets. That's basically all you get, right? That's that is the that is the circle of what we had to play with. As soon as you add fabric, you can add a whole bunch more things. And so the barrier to like okay again if I'm going back to this question again there's two systems that do not talk to each other and someone needs to do something in one or the other system to make it work. Once we get to fabric, we have data functions, API calls, changing data, real-time actions, like the the like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3287s" target="_blank">54:47</a> Which we say data platform, but I truly believe fabric becomes the data platform like you can do real time data right next to actionable data right next to like the SQL servers exist. You have you can have transactional data next to operational data like everything can work inside fabric. And so when I look at this question, it makes me think they're only in PowerBI and there they've limited the ability of what they can do based on what they know in PowerBI. As soon as you move to fabric, there's barriers that are described here that I think go away. You can do real

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3321s" target="_blank">55:21</a> Time actions on demand. And to to go back to this point here, right, the reason this automated reporting shows up is because someone has to have instructions and they need to update a name. That easy. So if the if going into a different system is that easy, my question would go back to is okay, is this other system that people need to click into? Is there an API we can access? Is there something I can do programmatically? though the thinking would be is if this is in fact

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3353s" target="_blank">55:53</a> True, build an experience inside your existing reporting where you can just solve the problem all one spot. And so to me, I look at this going that's what I'm looking for, right? I want to I want to build this roundroin experience. I I don't want to your point Tommy, people don't want to leave different programs. They don't want to keep jumping around different websites. They get lost. There's too many things. It gets confusing. I get that. I was in a job where we had like network drives and everything was stored all over the place and like you could never find anything, right? That's just that is a challenge.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3386s" target="_blank">56:26</a> Back to this person's question here is what can we do to build a more self-contained system where we're detecting changes, we're notifying people about issues, and that becomes the actionable area. And this is what Microsoft wants fabric to be. It's not just a place where you're looking at BI insights as an output. You're also interacting and making changes and fixing things right inside the system. Mike, I the more I think about this and I think we're we're realizing something here too. We're we're coming to a conclusion.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3419s" target="_blank">56:59</a> What are we doing if we're just on PowerBI still and I know a lot of organizations are still hesitant and this is going to be my closing thought here too. The email subscription has played a great place for situations especially around PowerBI. Sure. But if you're an organization and you're on the fence around fabric, it's time to get off get off the seat because even for me now, Mike, I maybe was more hesitant than most around fabric because I'm like, what, PowerBI can still be it. If someone offered me a job right now and it was just around PowerBI, I would

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3452s" target="_blank">57:32</a> Say no because we are so far ahead of that. It's short-sighted now. It's not even just short. Yeah, it's short it's shortsighted, but it's so much more than that. It's we are playing a different game now. and what we have available to us, not just because it's available to us, but what it can provide to an organization, what I have in my arsenal or what an organization to have in their tool belt to make people act, own, and have insights on their data is insane compared to what was just limited to PowerBI. PowerBI is still an incredible part of this, but let's not

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3486s" target="_blank">58:06</a> Let's let's not be mistaken. it is now just a part it is a cog in the machine of what's possible. I would agree that. So again I would this is where I'm going to echo knowing I've been tainted. Let's say it that way. I've been tainted. I the fact that I know what fabric can do and I do a lot of work around what it should be able to be capable of. a lot of these remedial things is like okay a lot of my questions are why why do we do it this way? What's the importance of it? Do we really need something to be emailed now? ,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3522s" target="_blank">58:42</a> I I I'm still even after this conversation, great great example. I think this is a really good example. I'm not trying to poo poo this idea or example. I think this is a great example. I think it's a really you found something that works in your system. Whatever you're using pure, it sounds like you're using just purely PowerBI. Great. It works for you. Keep doing it. That's fine. But what I would also argue is this to me emailing things or emailing data or reports or things that are supposed to be actionable to people it's a good way of of transitioning from the BI team to someone else who needs to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3556s" target="_blank">59:16</a> Take responsibility a lot. I I think this is the email in this example here is the medium by which you're transitioning things in it's it still has not convinced me that this is something I need to do. I'm still not going to encourage businesses to send out emails. I still don't think this is a solid enough of use case and now what I know about fabric and being tainted I now know there's also better ways. So at the end of the day I like this question. I think it's a very good use case. I think you found a really good process. , commend you on

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3587s" target="_blank">59:47</a> The things you've gotten to, but I still don't think I'm convinced that emailing or having subscriptions to stuff, data, things, objects. It still hasn't convinced me. I'm I'm still going to push for figure out how to make the PowerBI data app do all the things you need. And with Fabric, you have more capability than you ever have had before. And you can do more real time updating things, sending stuff, talking to APIs. It is so much more capable than it ever has been before.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3619s" target="_blank">60:19</a> Yeah, Mike, where on earth, and I know he's going to toot our own horn here, but where on earth can you find an hour listener talking about heated about email subscriptions in PowerBI? I don't know. I don't know. And I love it. I This is gets me I don't need coffee when we have these conversations. This is about email subscriptions. Shouldn't even be that entertaining. Let's even go forward with that. it's even like how much of your organization still runs on SS SSRS reporting started on that that's another whole realm this is the same thing I'm talking about though like it's like it's in to me schemes yeah

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3651s" target="_blank">60:51</a> This is in the same bucket like we're still doing a lot of these like static print outable report like and sometimes you need things like that like I do think there are times when you need PDFs of things to send to like customers or vendors or somewhere else but as I look at this going I'm I'm seeing there's a much better more modern way to address these SS SRS page like chunks of reporting. All right, with that being said, let's go ahead and wrap here. Thank you all for listening to the episode. I thought it was going to be a short one, but actually was a full-time one, so that's good. , thank you all for participating. Hopefully you got some insights around this one. , hope

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_Hnrcgjvk&t=3683s" target="_blank">61:23</a> You enjoyed our use case around subscriptions. Let us know in the comments, are you convinced? Should people still be using subscriptions or should we be building better solutions with data applications built inside Fabric? Let me know. Let us know in the description below. , if there any other use cases, feel free to send us another mailbag. Maybe we'll pick up your topic and I doubt you're going to convince me, but keep keep going. Like maybe maybe someone will get a use case here that I need.
