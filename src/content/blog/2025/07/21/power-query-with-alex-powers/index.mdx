Power Query is where report performance and data quality start. In this session, Alex Powers walks through the repeatable building blocks he uses to keep transformations fast, readable, and easy to hand off.

## Highlights

- Create a staging query layer that isolates raw sources.
- Use function-based transformations to reduce duplicated steps.
- Document parameters so your team can maintain the flow.

## Quick Tip

Wrap your most common cleanup steps in a function, then call it for every table. You’ll get consistent output and a shorter refresh time.
