## News & Announcements

### Deployment Pipeline Improvements (Unannounced!)

Mike discovered that deployment pipelines in Fabric have quietly received major upgrades — with zero blog announcement or documentation updates. Notebooks now auto-bind to lakehouses when moved through the pipeline (previously they'd stay pointed at the dev workspace). Even better, you can now see diffs between lakehouses and notebooks, including individual cell changes. Mike talked to the PM team and their response was essentially, "Yeah, it just works." Uncharacteristic of Microsoft to ship a feature this good without telling anyone.

Mike also introduces the concept of a **Release Manager** role — someone who sits across dev, test, and production environments, manages the deployment pipeline, works with the business on backlog, and pushes stakeholders to actually test things. Not quite a DevOps engineer, not quite a PM — a distinct role that organizations need but Microsoft hasn't formally identified.

### Surprise January Power BI Desktop Release

For the first time anyone can remember, Microsoft released a Power BI Desktop update in January (typically skipped due to December holidays). Released on January 20th — later than the usual mid-month window — which may push the February release schedule around.

### Power BI Desktop Feature Draft

Mike and Tommy do their signature feature draft from the January release:

- **PBIR as Default Format** — The Power BI Enhanced Report Format is now the default (still preview with opt-out). When GA hits in Q3 2026, it'll be the only format. Mike picks this for the Git integration and API access implications.

- **Column Sizing for Tables & Matrices** — Columns now size based on content by default, making tables more compact. Tommy picks this one. Mike pushes back — "lipstick on a pig" — and makes his case for Excel-like table parity: table slicers, pivot table functionality, the works.

- **Azure Maps Markers** — The Azure Maps visual finally gets markers, a feature every other map visual has had since launch. "It's a real boy now."

- **Format Pane Improvements** — Color picker now shows which color is selected (only took since 2015). Plus granular reset options at the card level instead of resetting the entire visual. Mike wants page-level and report-level reset next.

- **Q&A Deprecation** — Q&A is officially going away, replaced by Copilot.

- **Modern Visual Tooltips GA** — Finally leaving preview after being enabled since roughly 2019. That's about six years in preview.

- **Copilot on Home** — Standalone Copilot now appears on the Power BI homepage when enabled by tenant admin. Mike has concerns about admin control and notes it appeared on his tenant yesterday but disappeared today.

## Main Discussion: Is "Experience" Overused?

A listener writes in with a challenge: "I dare all the fabricators to start a game with the word experience. The word seems to be used everywhere for what we used to call a web page or an application. Riding a roller coaster or backpacking Europe are experiences. But opening a notebook or copy job — that's not an experience."

Mike searches the January update blog post and finds the word "experience" used **11 times** in a single article. Copilot experience. Search experience. Classic home experience. Toggle between experiences.

### The Apple Design Philosophy

Mike draws a parallel to Apple's design approach: they design for an **emotion**, a feeling, and then build the product around that feeling. The ChatGPT launch in 2022-2023 created a genuine experience — people were impressed by what a computer could do. That may be why "experience" has taken over as the buzzword: companies are chasing that emotional reaction.

### AI Is Changing What "Experience" Means

The conversation shifts to how AI agents are democratizing the ability to create experiences. Mike argues we've reached the pinnacle of programming languages: **natural language is the ultimate programming language**. You speak to the computer, it builds code. There's no further evolution beyond that — the improvement now is making AI better at interpreting what you say.

Mike references the "Ralph Wiggums" approach to AI agents: break a project into a detailed PRD with tiny tasks, let AI build each feature, auto-test it, and iterate. He predicts this will soon hit data engineering — imagine telling Copilot to build your entire pipeline, pick the right tools (copy job vs. notebook vs. pipeline), decide on incremental loading strategies, and execute.

### The Real Problem: Attention, Not Experience

Mike's take: Fabric doesn't have an "experience" problem — it has an **attention** problem. The tension between building flashy new features (which drive new users and revenue) versus polishing existing features (which retain current users) is real. Where's the Excel-like table? Where's the table slicer? Where's the improved filter pane? Those are the experiences that need improvement.

Tommy pushes back slightly — he thinks "experience" is the right word because Microsoft crammed six different careers into one UI, and they're genuinely trying to make each persona feel at home. He compares Fabric's notebook experience favorably to Google Colab: "Trying to use Google Colab is terrible."

### The Verdict

Both agree the word is overused — counted 11 times in one blog post. But the concept behind it isn't wrong. It's just the current-era version of what we used to call UI/UX. The real ask: stop naming things and start fixing things. Give us the table slicer. Give us page-level format resets. Those are the experiences people actually want.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=13s" target="_blank">0:13</a> [music] Welcome back to the Explicit Measures podcast with Tommy and Mike. Good morning everyone and welcome back to the show. Good morning, Mike. How you doing? I'm doing great, Tommy. All right, I got a couple news items, but before we get into the news pieces and some, we call this beat from the street, something we learned recently. I just want to point out here the main topic for today is going to talking about

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=47s" target="_blank">0:47</a> Experience overuse. the word experience, how you experience things, what are you working on? is is are we overusing this term right now in how we describe everything inside fabric and PowerBI? This seems like a buzz word. this is also a mailbag. This is a message from u one of our listeners. So, thank you very much listener for jumping in here and dropping us a topic. That being said, Tommy, let's go through a couple other news items here. One one item I'd like to throw out here is before we get into some news, I think we just had a release of PowerBI desktop that's actually just been released.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=80s" target="_blank">1:20</a> Yeah. on 120 and desktop is just starting to get pushed out to people. there's a big warning note there that the the January PowerBI release is really out today, which I'm surprised, Tommy. Typically, we don't ever get a PowerBI desktop release in January. I know. I typically remember us skipping the month of January and the first release, the first release we get is the one in February, which I find to be interesting. Yeah. And it looks like a lot of the things too are and I was going through it to see how

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=113s" target="_blank">1:53</a> Many new things there are and how many things they're just making updates to. Gone are the days of just pure desktop major features where there's like a new button somewhere. we're doing enhancements now, but yeah, we'll get into that. But Mike, I think you had something for me. Yeah, I got another experience thing. So in powerbay.com Tommy do you use deployment pipelines? I do. I do. definitely since gets taken over more and more but sure.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=145s" target="_blank">2:25</a> Oh yeah. So I think I think the deployment pipelines in the past had some weaknesses and so some of the weaknesses around deployment pipelines were particularly around notebooks and lakehouses. Did you ever try to run a notebook or a lakehouse through a deployment pipeline? No, I did not. Okay. So, my last impression of deployment pipelines. So, for those of you who are not familiar with what a deployment pipeline is, this is a premium level feature. It's on premium per user or anything in the fabric fu levels. And

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=179s" target="_blank">2:59</a> What the idea of this is a deployment pipeline takes items that exist in a singular workspace, your development workspace, and you move it to another workspace. Now, Tommy, we talked about this a while ago, like how deployment pipelines made it easier to deploy semantic models and how you can make a deployment pipeline move that semantic model from dev to test. And then if you have a report bound to the development semantic model and you move the report from dev to test, the report automagically rebinds itself to the test semantic model. So you can move things along through this pipeline and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=212s" target="_blank">3:32</a> It automatically knows, oh, I was connected to this semantic model. It was named this. I'm now moving to this next workspace that has a new semantic model. Great. Super helpful. Well, when you moved over to notebooks and and lakehouses, Tommy, we would bring in data through our notebook or a pipeline or something like that. We get data to the lakehouse and then you would have notebooks touch that lakehouse, read the information, and then push it to the next level. Well, that in the past had never worked. You would deploy a lakehouse, you would move it to the next environment, and the notebook would

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=245s" target="_blank">4:05</a> Still be pointed back at the original development workspace. Something's been fixed. There's been no blog announcement about it. There's been nothing else. And so now it maybe I missed it. I could have totally missed this, but I love deployment pipelines. I think they're great for, starting to provide some rigor to business teams to start developing things with a regular pattern. Here's where we build test. Here's where we build production. Here's where we build test. So even dev prodation. I think it's not so overly complicated to to confuse people. But I think

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=278s" target="_blank">4:38</a> It's a very reasonable way to think about that. Interesting. So now notebooks are autobinding when you move the lakehouse. One, I love that. And then two, if you go into the deployment pipeline and then after the deployment, you go look at the diffs. There's you've been able to see diffs of just semantic models and reports. You can now see diffs between lakehouses. You can now see diffs between notebooks. You can see which cells have changed in which part of the notebook. You can see all the metadata of the notebook as it's moving from one place to another. There's a lot more information in the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=312s" target="_blank">5:12</a> Deployment pipeline now. And I having I'm mystified, Tommy. I'm mystified because when did this happen? How come I didn't see a blog about it? And I I literally saw that feature and thought, "Oh my gosh, I need to tell the podcast about this. This is amazing. This is I'm going to gush about it because I like it so much. It's so good." Mike, I you and I are the ones who are scouring the web for features and updates and yeah, I don't I can't remember the last time on a blog or

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=344s" target="_blank">5:44</a> Twitter that there's actually been a mention. Nothing. I've even talked to the PM team. I said, "Hey, PM team, this just works." They're like They're like, "Yeah, it just works." I'm like, "Wait a minute. What?" I said, "There's no announcement about this. That's this didn't work like a couple months ago. When did this show up? I don't know what you like you're improving things but no one posted it. There's nothing out there. I don't get to like I'm totally missed it and I would have loved to have pushed that out and talked to people about it but Microsoft is improving some things here that seems very uncharacteristic of Microsoft to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=376s" target="_blank">6:16</a> Push out a feature that no one actually knew changed. I will say this, this is a very big creature comfort feature for me. I like it very much. If I'm doing a deployment between different environments, I have to see the definition of what's going on. I really want to see line by line what's the difference between the two items. it's sadly though one, as I as I gush about the feature, I'll give you one slight improvement, Mr. Microsoft, if you're listening. when you do a diff on the semantic model, you're still using the BIM format. I'

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=408s" target="_blank">6:48</a> I'd prefer you to use TIMDLE or something else or at least have a button to switch over to TIMDLE so it's easier for me to read the differences in semantic models. But other than that, other than the fact that there's a little bit of weirdness on the semantic model level, I'm already getting better, a much more improved experience when using deployment pipelines like it. Okay. Well, deployment pipelines, it's good to know, Mike, how much though have you really shifted just because of Git or do you still really find deployment pipelines having like an integral value? Yeah, Tommy, I've done a very

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=442s" target="_blank">7:22</a> Deep dive on like Git integration either Azure DevOps or GitHub. We definitely want to attach that stuff into the development workspace. I think that's a definitely a given. It's very easy to use Git and we think of it more as like a backup at this point. certain teams aren't comfortable with doing pull requests, pulling content down, developing local with the git repos. Most people like to stay inside the workspace. So I think on the larger organization size git and git or git makes a lot of sense because there's

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=475s" target="_blank">7:55</a> A pretty steep learning curve I think with people and understanding and when you come out of the BI stack world you're not used to doing branching or branching strategies that's that's definitely more of a software development side of things but I I'm using a lot more Tommy I think when you even in some large organizations that are just like look we just need to get stuff out the door we're not looking to get super technical on every little action that comes out of a GitHub or Azure DevOps. We don't want to add a lot of We want to add automation, but only to a certain degree. We still need a human a loop. Deployment pipelines are great. It it seems to be fairly

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=507s" target="_blank">8:27</a> Reasonable. And one other observation, Tommy, I'll put out here. This is a side note to what you're saying. Deployment pipelines, great. Like them. I think they're very strong. They should be used more. There's this role that is not being talked about that Microsoft hasn't really identified. When you talk to Microsoft about deployment pipelines, they're like, "Oh yeah, you're DevOps engineer. You're development operations." And yes, you're doing some level of DevOps, maybe you're linking back to Git or GitHub. That's what the DevOps engineer should be doing. But I believe

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=540s" target="_blank">9:00</a> There's a different role of someone who needs to be in charge of the development, the pipeline, and moving content through. And I I was just talking with a really big customer recently, and I said, "Look, I want to introduce this concept to you of the release manager." And they're like, hm, what do you mean by that? And when I explained my concept of the release manager, this is an individual who sits across can see development, test, and production. It works with the development team on backlog and ticketing and getting things done. So a little bit of a PM hat on that. In addition to that, that person

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=573s" target="_blank">9:33</a> Knows how to move content from dev dev to test. They know how to do some of the DevOps level things, but also I think they're very technical in the fact that they're also part admin. They're in the admin portal. They're looking at admin settings. So, I really do think that there is this role, a series of actions you must do called the release manager. One who PMs the project, works with the business to figure out what they need and how we're getting it out the door to them. Working with the development team and making sure that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=604s" target="_blank">10:04</a> The tickets are right. getting the the deployments corrected, getting the right content through each of the different steps in the pipeline, notifying stakeholders when things show up in test, hey, test this, pushing on the stakeholders and test and making sure they don't delay on testing because they could sit on test items for three weeks or a week or a month. And what happens is they if they don't approve the tests, you really shouldn't be pulling more things from dev into test again. So you either need to say yes, we approve, move forward, or no, we kick it out and we move it back. So, we've had to like do some pretty hard rules

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=636s" target="_blank">10:36</a> Sometimes, like you have a week to review this. If you don't give us any feedback in a week, we assume it's good. We're going to roll it through and we're going to put in the next change. And if it's wrong, you're it's your neck on the line, right? So, there needs to be some really rigor around how you get stuff out the door because teams can easily create a bottleneck in your pipeline of deploying things. Dude, that was maybe the best monologue on pipelines I've heard in a long time. So, good to know, dude. It is. How many monologues you listening to about pipelines? That's like not many.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=669s" target="_blank">11:09</a> Second one I've said. Oh, that's definitely one of the best ones. This is one of the best ones, dude. I love it. I absolutely love it. But hopefully we'll see that update in the blog and in the documentation as well because I don't know. I looked for the documentation. They did talk about like the comparing the diffs. Nothing in the documentation talked about the exception or the addition of notebooks. There's nothing. Like I was I was floored, Tommy. Honestly, I was like, where where does this I went looking through the docs and I I could find the fact that they were doing diffs and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=702s" target="_blank">11:42</a> Compares, but I was not finding the fact that diffs and compares now have more items. I would have thought at least announcement or something like said, hey, look, here's the equivalent items that are now being deployed in a workspace that you can use in a deployment pipeline. Here's the ones where it's supported with showing diffs. Apparently, everything is supported now. I don't know. I'll have to go look at it. I know there are some exceptions to the rule. At least there was. I'll have to go check those next. Dude, awesome. Well, hey, I think we need to get into PowerBI's feature update because Mike, they're actually

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=735s" target="_blank">12:15</a> Not as bad as I thought. Yeah, we typically don't get a feature update in January. This is the time where Microsoft takes off from holidays. Again, Tommy, my impression here is the release in January is predicated on all the work being done in December, right? So, since no one's really working in December, you really don't get a release in January. Also, Tommy, I'll note here, it's interesting that they're doing this. Typically, they release PowerBI desktop files on like the 12th to the 17th, I think.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=769s" target="_blank">12:49</a> Feels like the beginning like the the beginning third of the month, maybe. This is going to throw things off a little bit because if they're releasing now on the 20th, we're going to have like two weeks and then another release. So, I'm not really sure if that means we're going to get like a delayed or some weird delay into February now. But anyway, just just thinking through that out loud. Ah, interesting. Well, hey, Mike, let's do our favorite way. Our draft, the first draft of the year. We have about 15 or like 10 to 12 pretty good features. So, I will let you go first.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=802s" target="_blank">13:22</a> You can pick whatever you want. Yeah, I'm gonna probably I'm going to steal hopefully your thunder here, Tommy. I don't I don't know if this is going to be really what you're thinking. I'm going to go after the developer and APIs. Again, I'm way more technical than most. The PowerBI enhanced report format, PBIR, is now the default format. That is how things are built nowadays. Yeah, that is crazy. So, it's still in it's still in preview with the opt out option,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=835s" target="_blank">13:55</a> Correct? but once it does become generally available in Q3 2026 that's going to be the only format available in desktop. Yes. So I think for me looking at that one like that that's this is adding a lot of capability for professional developers to your point Tommy a lot of the git the git integration API access when you talk to reports every time do do you still get that message a lot Tommy I think I've got it turned on in my PowerBI desktop if you open an old file it now automatically prompts you hey would you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=868s" target="_blank">14:28</a> Like to update this file to the new PBIR format are you see are you seeing that in desktop now yeah know that update I've been getting that update a few times. So, yeah. So, I like that one cuz this is means Microsoft is aggressively asking you to update and push towards the new format, which I think is really good. This is going to be the new way that we're going to be building things. We've got to embrace it. We've got to learn it. We've got plenty of time. It doesn't really change too much. The PBX still looks the same, but under the hood inside the PBX or if you save the the PowerBI report as a PBIP project, all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=903s" target="_blank">15:03</a> The files that you would get for the report, the theme files, the data model, everything is now updated to this new format. So, I really like this one. It It's probably a very detailed technical one, but that's the one I'm I'm going to pick off for my first one. I like that one. Thankful that that's happening. All right. So, I'm actually going to go with one for tables and matrixes. Man, I'm surprised you didn't go for this one. Our our our taboo, our holy grail is getting the perfect table in PowerBI. And they made a minor

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=938s" target="_blank">15:38</a> Update, but for me, this is something that's going to save a few headaches. Column sizing updates for tables and matrixes. So before if you want to auto size a column in a table or matrix, yes, you it would just autosize and it would fill the available space it would they were making some updates in October and November of last year. But now the behaviors changed. So in reports that are created from this release onward, columns can once been can be sized by default based on the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=973s" target="_blank">16:13</a> Content that they contain. So that makes tables and matrixes a little more compact and easier to read. You can still manually update the column width or you can use a feature called grow to fit to expand columns when needed rather than like oh no use autosize and it becomes one of those terrible terrible situations. Sure. So this is good. By default visuals are going to prioritize content driven sizing. So it's going to be a little more easier at least when you say you like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1008s" target="_blank">16:48</a> Auto size it. So this is pretty cool. Mike, I'm gonna give you why I didn't pick this one. This is just lipstick on a pig at this point. Isn't that Yes. Maybe it adds a little bit of assistance here. Maybe it scales the things. Tables I just struggle with in general inside PowerBI desktop. Like I don't really want a table the way Microsoft has presented tables. What I really want is get me back my Excel table. Give me back what I had previously inside Excel that for years I've been able to get there needs to be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1041s" target="_blank">17:21</a> A table slicer something whatever whatever you want to call it. There's got to be like a table slicer. Select something from a column just the way you do inside Excel and then everything on the page updates when you filter down the column of information. I want a pivot table just like I would build them inside Excel. why we can't get that figured out and make those two things happen. It's beyond me. Like this is a nice feature. I wonder what happens when you have lots of columns that extend the boundary of the window of the of the table and then you then

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1074s" target="_blank">17:54</a> Turn it on to grow to fit. What does it hap? What happens? Does the scroll bar show up? How does that work? So, I'm not quite sure about some of the rules around this one. So, I I think this is okay feature for me. I feel like tables and matrices are really missing a core functionality and they just need parody with Excel. I'm going to keep hanging on that one. I know that's probably a lot of work. It's never going to happen. I don't know. I don't know. Fine. It never happens. Build a new visual, Microsoft. Go build a new visual that makes it feel just like just like a table in Excel. That's what I want. I would argue a lot of people. Maybe

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1107s" target="_blank">18:27</a> Microsoft's doing that intentionally to not give you that experience. So to push you towards pageionated stuff because you really shouldn't be dropping in massive big wide tables inside PowerBI reports. They don't perform really well. So maybe there's a strategic reason why they're not doing it. But I don't really like it. I think they want people away from tables, too. That's probably why. Also, it's written in JavaScript. So all right, that's mine. I'll still I'll take it. what? You can be hard on it. You can say it's not enough, but I'll take it. I'll take the feature update. , something that it may not be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1140s" target="_blank">19:00</a> Perfect, but it's something. Tommy, I'm surprised you didn't pick the other one here that I thought you would definitely pick. The co-pilot ones. No. Introducing markers on the Azure maps visual because everyone loves mapping mapping visuals. Wow, we can mark. Yes, this is one of those definitely every other map [laughter] visual has it has has had it since PowerBI has been out, but now the Azure map one has it. what's funny though too? I have always loved the Azure map. I was my default one. I thought even though it couldn't do marking, which was an issue, I did love how it it it shaded and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1174s" target="_blank">19:34</a> Colored in. So now it's a complete tool. It's a real It's a It's a real toy. It's a real boy now. So congratulations, Azure. Yeah, I I'm going to pick on maybe this is an obtuse one, Tommy. I'm not sure if this is really re really thing. I struggle a lot with the format pain. The format pain and I have problems. We have issues. We we we we fight a lot. So, me being in the format pain, there's too much stuff. I can't find things. I'm always using search. It doesn't it doesn't feel fluid enough. There's so many properties for a single visual. It's just difficult. So, Tommy,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1208s" target="_blank">20:08</a> Here we go. Format pane improvements. When you're in the color picker and you select a color, Tommy, now for the first time since 2015, you can now see what color you've selected. That's insane. It's [laughter] insane. I should I should have started with this. This is a great one. So, I really like this one. It's so you don't need to build rocket science things. You need to simplify and like do some simple things. So, now the theme colors that you pick when you click on an object and you see a color has been selected, you can then

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1240s" target="_blank">20:40</a> At least see what item has been selected on the little grid area. Like it. I think that's great. Another improvement, dude. There is now That's a major one. That's a pretty big one. I think again it's usability, right? This is like creature comforts that just got to be there, right? Another one that's I think pretty useful here. Granular reset options in the format pane. Okay, so when you're clicking around and modifying something on the on the filter pane, there's an ellipsus at the upper right hand corner of the settings of the visual. You've always

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1273s" target="_blank">21:13</a> I always use this one. I do use this one. This is fairly frequent, but it was pretty heavy-handed. You can reset all settings for the entire visual. So any setting you set, you can reset everything to default. Yes. Got it. Now they have a in the individual section. So how you have the different sections that expand the accordion. They call those accordians. The accordion that expands and at the very bottom hidden in the bottom little tiny corner it says reset to default. So you can reset a single section to default, which we've had that for a while. But it looks like now you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1308s" target="_blank">21:48</a> Can also rightclick on the card in the section. So now we have the accordion, and then in the accordion there's now individual sections within that accordion area. So for example, you may have a color, you may have the border, right? The color is its own card. The border is its own card. And you can collapse and expand the cards as well. Now, they're going to let you reset the card or the individual sections defaults as opposed to the whole thing. So, if you were setting multiple things, you can now reset a single card item of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1343s" target="_blank">22:23</a> Elements. I do a lot of playing around, Tommy. You can you tell I'm very passionate about this part of the the world of PowerBI. I build a tool called Power Designer. It is by far the best tool out there for stylized reports. , it has the most robust and all the updated features for all the theme properties. There's a lot of theme generators out there today. They don't have all the properties. They're missing stuff all the time. Every month we're trying to check and update to make sure that we have the latest features inside our our toolbar. So that we're we're ahead of the game. And also our power designer, we've got

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1377s" target="_blank">22:57</a> Previews. You want to go preview your theme file on an existing report. There aren't any many there many tools out there that are doing this all in one package. So, I think we've got the most robust template and report theming design tool that you're going to see out there. So, anyways, I'm passionate about improving the filter pane settings, having that become simpler, having it become more settings, easier to reset things when they're when they're a problem. The only setting I'm going to rag on this one, I love this. This is good. Filter Pane's great. We need another setting on,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1413s" target="_blank">23:33</a> Let's call it the tabs across the bottom of the page of the report. We need another setting where you rightclick and you can reset all styles on a page. I need to be able to reset all styles throughout the entire report. Those two features do not exist. And I do think people, especially as they're building like theme files and trying to test things and figure out what works and what doesn't work, there's a lot of times where you're going to need to reset everything to default because some user has adjusted something and it's overriding the theme file. So I don't want to have to go through and select

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1446s" target="_blank">24:06</a> Every single visual and then click reset and put back to default. So to be very clear here, that's a missing feature of this reset to default area, which I'd like to see implemented more broadly at the page and the report level. Maybe there maybe there's an idea coming from Power Designer that you might see coming out here in the future. So anyways, yeah, honestly though, Mike, when it comes to formatting, listen, I'm a huge proponent of your tool, the PowerBI tips theme designer. Of course you are.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1477s" target="_blank">24:37</a> V1 since version one which I think is still available. version one's no long I think we've I think we've deprecated version one. It used to be super simple was just like here's here's 10 colors that you have. You can just literally enter in 10 colors and get a theme from it. Yeah, it was the first theme tool that was out there with they announced theming and I thought this is amazing but I hate writing JSON. And within a week or two of them announcing the feature, I had already made a theme generator tool and started building on top of it. And we've been building this tool since oh

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1510s" target="_blank">25:10</a> Gosh, it's been quite a while, Tommy, since we announced it. Seven years is how long the theme generator's been out? maybe even more. I can't remember. It literally when the feature was released, we were right there on top of it within a week or two having our own theme generator experience already out there for you to use. So, yeah, we're probably the oldest theme generator and the most robust theme generator. Now, we're building full-on PBIP project files. We can now use templates. Oh, speaking of which, Tommy, I got a I've got a plug here if you don't mind. Okay. Inside the power So, we have the theme generator, which is we call that themes.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1544s" target="_blank">25:44</a> PowerBI tips. That's the website. The same product also exists inside Microsoft Fabric as Power Designer. That's why I keep calling it Power Designer. It's our theme generator. Inside Power Designer, we now have added an enterprise option. So Tommy, imagine you're building themes or theme files or you're building a report with pages and backgrounds and colors, right? You want to create a enterprise collection of all your enterprise theme files, things that you want to share with your whole organization. Now, anyone in your organization can download the theme

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1576s" target="_blank">26:16</a> Generator, put it in their workspace, and they can browse the enterprise theme gallery. These are all the themes and templates that you made for your organization. You can one button deploy them into any workspace you want right from the tool. So it it bundles the file up. It deploys it and then it asks you to bind yourself to a semantic model. So you can take an existing template report, autobind it to a semantic model and have it deployed in a workspace. And then it gives you a link to get there. No other tools doing this. like we are we're the only tool providing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1608s" target="_blank">26:48</a> Enterprisegrade templating and solutioning around theme files. So anyways, I just highlight that we just released that this month. So very excited to see enterprises start using theme generations as well. I think it's going to add them or save them a lot of time at a minimum. Congratulations, my friend. All right. So, speaking of deprecation and also things I thought were already out, the Q&amp;A deprecation is actually happening for PowerBI, which I'm sad about because I remember I did try to push that so much.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1641s" target="_blank">27:21</a> So, again, it's going to be a replaced by Copilot. And then they had something about the modern visual tool tips. And I remember thinking to myself, hasn't that been around since like 2019, modern visual tool tips. Yeah. They they have this whole section on modern visual tool tips and it says, "Hey, you can do drill actions. There's a new actions footer. Let users drill down or drill up styling." And wow. So that means like it's been in preview this whole time,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1673s" target="_blank">27:53</a> I guess. that's like eight years or six years. Okay. Okay. Yeah. On one hand, I'm like, I've turn these things on and forgot they were even in preview. Yes. I just used them. And when I do dashboard in day, I make users change that setting. Yeah. Okay. This is good. Okay. I like seeing this. I like seeing things get knocked off and get out into G. Get that. So, your preview list of features inside PowerBI desktop should not be a scrollable list. Can we get Can we at

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1705s" target="_blank">28:25</a> Least get that list down to a non-scrollable list, please? Oh, man. So, that's one area there. , I'd like to see that. This is cool. I'm I'm glad that they're finishing up this feature. I don't know. This is one thing I'm not quite sure, Tommy. So, a lot of times they put something into preview, it gets out the door, we see if there's usage on it, and then Microsoft has to apply people towards the process or that product or that that item, and then finish it up, right? There's usually some missing features. There's something that they need to do to internally say, "Yeah, this is ready to go. G, whatever that is. I don't know." But I'm happy that they're cleaning up a lot of these

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1738s" target="_blank">28:58</a> Little features. Spanish Q&amp;A, anyone? I think we can deprecate that one now because I guess Q&amp;A is going away. So, you have the Spanish. So, that one's going to be deprecated. Yeah. And the the last one I think worth mentioning, there's one on field parameters. I'll I'll save the time. the standalone co-pilot on the homepage. I know they talked about this already at one. Okay, Tommy, this made me concerned honestly. This just showed up on my tenants recently. I'm concerned about this. Why? I have concerns. Just announce the feature first and then I'll I'll tell you my concerns. Go

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1771s" target="_blank">29:31</a> Ahead. Co-pilot is now on home. So yeah. So the co-pilot's standalone on the homepage. So even though they're introduced it, it was something they already introduced right now. There's an entry point on your lefthand side where you have your workspaces, the browse. copilot is closer than ever in PowerBI. so it's basically directly when you go to PowerBI home, you get copilot with faster insights, easier discovery, and when does it appear? it shows up when it standalone

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1803s" target="_blank">30:03</a> Co-pilots enabled by your tenant admin. , yeah. So, that's basically what it is. It is going to take the place if you have co-pilot standalone. So, I'm going to go two two things I want to call out here. When does this co-pilot on home experience show up? How does it turn on for users? It shows up when standalone co-pilot is enabled, turned on in your tenant. So, you have to have that setting on. So, if you don't see this co-pilot on the homepage, literally what they mean by home is the little house icon at the top of the of the navar menu on the lefth

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1838s" target="_blank">30:38</a> Hand side of the screen. That home icon up there, that's the icon we're talking about. That's the home icon for what you see there. So, co-pilot standalone copilot has to be enabled and you must have a valid co-pilot capacity. Yes, it doesn't this is what I'm a little bit leerary about, right? A valid cola pilot capacity means any fabric skew. So if you have a fabric skew, does that just turn it on? Also here, if you don't like that one and you prefer the classic view with

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1871s" target="_blank">31:11</a> Just some random cards that really don't take you anywhere and actually add a lot of value to you, you can always switch back to your recommended content at the top of the page, but you do that at the picker at the top of the homepage. So I'm looking at this Tommy going, it seems like they're really forcing this on this. There's no mention in here about an admin setting that says as an admin I want to force everyone to have the recommended content as opposed to using co-pilot. So you may have co-pilot on, you may have a different places, but it doesn't feel

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1902s" target="_blank">31:42</a> Like there's an there's an admin control to adjust this. Yeah, I don't know about that. There's only like two or three settings in tenant simply saying users can use copilot and other features powered by Azure OpenAI. Yep. And then there's now no one users can access a standalone cross item PowerBI copilot experience. Yes. it is frustrating that we can't use because to your point we cannot use the like our co-pilot that we have for Office 365. We actually have to make sure that we're actually using a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1936s" target="_blank">32:16</a> Like to your point the fabric capacity co-pilot. Tommy I'm I'm gonna go on a limb here. How how much time do you spend on the homepage of PowerBI? that's where I direct all my users to all the time. So yeah, I say that's where you start. That's what you bookmark. I don't spend time at all there, but I'm also not usually just browsing. So I feel like what I would like So okay, fine. Copilot home experience is there. You can see it. Fine. I'm looking at this going, I really want to if I look

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=1970s" target="_blank">32:50</a> At the content that's the top of the page. I'm not really loving the fact that it's always that top part of just the recommended items or co-pilot. I really feel like data discovery, new reports, , something around like the one lake catalog, a little bit of like interesting things from there, discover new data you haven't seen or here's some new tables that have showed up or here's a new lakehouse. like there there's almost like a little bit of a news feed that I feel like would be more relevant here on this page. Now, I will say this on the homepage, I do use the homepage a lot. I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2003s" target="_blank">33:23</a> Typically do not use recent. My favorite thing to use is favorite a couple of items. Favorites should be favorites should be one of the options front and center. Favorites should be highlighted. I think they've done a miss here. the the favorites is honestly Tommy I would even prefer instead of home I would like to pin favorites as a core button on the left side of the page. Oh yeah. And what if I right? Yes. Okay. So I think and I Donald thank you for also injecting your

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2036s" target="_blank">33:56</a> Comments here too. Donald also says he likes favorites there instead. So I think more highlighting around what favorites are. maybe I could, make a little thumbnail for like my report and then have that there. I would like to see a couple like really handy reports that are just sitting there right on the right on the homepage. My favorites. Boom. Right there, highlighted nice and center. I don't need Copilot. I'm not going to ask I'm not going to go to the homepage and start typing something to talk to copilot to go find something that I already know what I'm looking for. I honestly I'm just showing up to powerbi.com to go hit an existing report that I'm going to go do. Especially if you use it as a search

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2067s" target="_blank">34:27</a> Feature. Mike, I don't want it to reason or, or or ponder my question. It's just like, no, go find things that start with this. Yes. Yes. [sighs] If you have that, then I would say everything's got to be approved by copilot, which is now that they've changed the name to the prep for AI is just approved for co-pilot. If you want to have things prepped for AI or Yes. It's just going to be a hodgepodge of things. So, I don't know, Tommy. This is interesting. We'll we'll see where this goes. I'm not sure how this is going to roll out. , and also interesting in my

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2101s" target="_blank">35:01</a> Tenants, I was seeing it show up yesterday and today I don't see it. So, both my tenants right now, I'm refreshing my pages. I don't know if there was a setting that flipped or something, but I was seeing it yesterday when maybe they were rolling out code and for whatever reason now in both my tenants, I'm looking at it right now. Both of them are still showing recommended. So, I maybe something was wrong and someone's rolling a feature back here. I'm not quite sure what happened. , we'll have to get an inside scoop, but yesterday I was seeing the co-pilot on home. Today I am not. I am in the North Central region. So, I don't know if that means

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2133s" target="_blank">35:33</a> Anything if, something rolled back there or or it's changing in other regions. So, I'll check my other tenants that I have access to and see if that's actually there or not. Anyways, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We've been talking a lot about news, fun things, , releases. Awesome. Very fun. Enjoy those those moments there. Let's get into our main topic today. Tommy, give us our main topic. , let's talk about the overuse experience or the overemphasis on experience. All right. So, I'm going to read the mailbag here. It's a pretty good one. Well written. So, here we go. I dare all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2167s" target="_blank">36:07</a> The fabricators to start a game with the word experience. The word seems to be used everywhere for what we used to call a web page or an application. Already hot take. Yep. Riding a roller coaster or backpacking Europe are experiences. But opening a notebook or copy job, that's not an experience. Let's look at the actual definition of experience. Experience is a noun. A particular instance of personally encountering or undergoing something. Example, my encounter with the bear in the woods.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2201s" target="_blank">36:41</a> The process or effect of personally observing, encountering, or Yep, we just did that. The observing, encountering or undergoing of things generally as they occur in the course of time to learn from experience. Knowledge of practical wis wisdom gained from what one has observed encounter undergone. A [clears throat] man of experience in philosophy the totality given by perception. All that is perceived, understood and remembered. And that's all he wrote in terms of really I think obviously Mike we have a listener who is fed up with all of the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2238s" target="_blank">37:18</a> Blogs and the conferences saying oh my gosh we have this amazing new co-pilot I think it probably said the word the standalone co-pilot experience experience. Yeah. Did it actually say that? Let me actually I'm going to here I'm going to I'm going to buzzword search this right now. I'm going to go to the summary for this month and I'm going to search for 11 times. 11 times in the just this article. Okay. So, if we were playing any drinking game, it would be like that would be 11 sips right there. So, yeah, inside the co-pilot exper right there, Tommy, right there. You nailed it. Co-pilot experience. The co-pilot

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2271s" target="_blank">37:51</a> Search experience. Yeah, a lot of this is being buzzworded. Capture AI is an experience tool. Toggle between the experiences between PowerBI and fabric, right? the classic home experience, . So, so what's the rub here? What is the rub on the overuse of experiences? are we not experiencing something when we're going into these products that anyone makes for that matter, right? Is there's always some emotion that's evoked when you go there? Yes and no. Because this is it's funny because I've been reading a few articles

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2303s" target="_blank">38:23</a> Lately about the whole onflux of AI agents and you mentioned this too where everyone is creating creating creating but you like you're realizing there's still a void like where nothing's getting perfected. People are just putting more more things out there and we're going away from the traditional experience of planning to build something or planning to work or create something. Right now, if you have a thought in your head, going to the bathroom, you can create an app

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2336s" target="_blank">38:56</a> And or just have another thing created and another thing started. You're not you're not talking about apps about going to the bathroom. You're talking about the idea of creating the app is that it can be made an experience to be to go to the bathroom and back. Is that what you're referring to? Yes. To be fair, going to the bathroom is an experience. Let's keep it above board, Tommy. Let's keep it above board. But like now I have all these halfbuilt apps on my computer or on GitHub. Oh, this is good, Tommy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You see where I'm going with this? So, I saw a really funny meme yesterday about exactly what you're talking about, Tommy. man, before AI, I only had like one or two unsolved projects

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2370s" target="_blank">39:30</a> Sitting on my my my desk, right? I always had a couple side projects working on. And now with AI, I have 10 or 15 side projects that I haven't finished. [laughter] So I feel I can feel the same commiseration, Tommy. I feel the same thing. , let me I want to pick on this comment around the experience. So I understand the word experience is probably a fad right now. It's a fad around what does the user experience. I think more of what this is going after and maybe this is a co-pilot or an AI

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2403s" target="_blank">40:03</a> Enabled something right Tommy Apple did a really good marketing advertisement I guess it would be a couple years ago and they had all these things around what why Apple does things why Apple designs what they design why Apple has the product the way they have it and they said what they try to design for that has made them so successful is they design for an emotion a feeling. That's what they design for. And so they pick the feeling of what they want to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2436s" target="_blank">40:36</a> Design against. And then from there, they try and have every lens of that become part of the product, right? And so if we look back at some of those experiences that I felt with Copilot, right, when they first came out or some of those first experiences around chat GPT, right? remember when that thing landed like was it three three years ago 2023 is that when it landed I don't even remember I think 23 yeah 2023 or 2022 but anyways when that landed Tommy that changed the game that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2470s" target="_blank">41:10</a> We didn't know it at the time but we looked at what was happening in large language models and there was a there was an experience we had there that evoked this emotion of like I was impressed I didn't think a computer could do It was doing things that I didn't think it was summarizing information. It was pulling together summaries. It was doing stuff that was traditionally harder and only search browser driven. And I think that maybe was the lynch pin here as to why we're seeing the word experience

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2503s" target="_blank">41:43</a> Increase a lot because we're we're we're continually trying to seek after this. If the user has a good experience, they'll come back and use the product again. What do you think? and I think no I think you're exactly in terms of especially where you have halfbuilt things we're not having to plan again or devote as much time into quickly trying to do things and I think right now we're also seeing that in and I don't think it's just Microsoft I I I would be hardressed to say it's just Microsoft and the fabric team who is are trying to do this it's it's I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2535s" target="_blank">42:15</a> Think any company right now both from the AI side but also the rapid development of you have a subscription a company has their subscription so we have to turn out major features and especially when it comes to anything in the data world I think anything you see the same thing with like Azure and AWS and Google and obviously everyone is trying to be at the latest greatest with with anything that's agentbased or AI and yeah like there's so much focus when I'm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2569s" target="_blank">42:49</a> In the UI and fabric , and you see how much the Microsoft team also cares about this too in terms of what experience you're going to get. , and when fabric first came out, I remember it was, hey, based on your persona, are you a data engine? They had those four buttons or those four , I don't know what they're called, boxes saying, choose your path. Basically, they scrapped that. Then now they have like the if you can go to fabric rather than , powerbi.com. So app.fabric, fabric, you get a different experience even

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2601s" target="_blank">43:21</a> Though it's the same UI. And I think it's important, Mike, like I don't want to downplay what our our listeners said, but at the same time, I'm disagreeing with him. I think let me go back to AI and what AI is doing to things here, Tommy. Right. I think this is interesting or at least if nothing else it's just a concept that I think is fun to like toy with the idea here to unpack a little bit right what

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2634s" target="_blank">43:54</a> Happens when you take a website that would normally have taken you hours to build right you're using a framework like WordPress you've got to go find a template a lot of those templates that are out there are gated by pay walls so you got to pay some money to get something to be done right and at the end of the day you can get to a result that is here's a website here's how it works here's how the buttons and the interactions a lot of those things you delegate off to other people Tommy right the experience of what you how you interact with things I don't actually

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2667s" target="_blank">44:27</a> Get to control it I can't I can't as a developer or as a as a user of another product right I don't get the ability to refine the style of the button or are there animations and what animation is there and when you click it is there a shadow that appears or not appear All of that really informs that experience of what you work with things. Now inject for me AI and agents. Now when you drop in agents now that experience can be delegated. I can program any website any

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2704s" target="_blank">45:04</a> Application just by talking and speaking with the AI. So, what we've done, I think over in recent years, is we're now able to delegate, , democratize. I I don't know what word we're going to use here, but we're going to be able to distribute the ability for anyone to create any experience. And I think a lot of people in in software development are always clamoring now around what does the experience feel like, right? I I feel we are in in a very exciting time. I think Tommy with this we are in the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2739s" target="_blank">45:39</a> Middle from a software developer standpoint from building products and code and things there's I'm going to mark my words Tommy we are right around the corner to massive disruption when it comes to data engineering and data pipelines. Massive disruption. We've seen AI disrupt the ability for you to build websites and code and Python and things. It's been very good. It's been supplemental to what I do. But Tommy, imagine imagine now

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2773s" target="_blank">46:13</a> If you're going to just throw tasks at an AI. This we're like there's stuff that's happening. Have you heard about this Ralph Wiggums thing for AI agents? I need to I am worried to get too into it, but yeah, I've been see that's been Tommy, be careful. Be careful. This is a rabbit hole that could eat up hours. Everything is a time suck these days when it comes to AI. This is another thing. Every two weeks we're getting some other new revolutionary way of doing things. This Ralph Wiggums way of thinking is okay, you're going to build something. Maybe it's an application, maybe it's some

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2805s" target="_blank">46:45</a> Styled UI, maybe it's a full-blown something, whatever you're going to build, doesn't matter. You have to really work on the plan of what you're building. and you break it down into this little PRD file that allows you to design the plan, the planning of what you're going to do. And it makes these little mini tasks. Here's task one. And it breaks it down to these little tiny tasks that the AI can go do. And it adds automation to say, "Okay, AI, go build the feature. AI, go create some tests and test this feature as if you were a human." And then if that test passes,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2838s" target="_blank">47:18</a> Move on to the next feature. And so now we're building AI to be able to not only just build the feature and test it and go build the next feature. It's now iteratively building these things over and over and over again and cycling through this stuff. And we're in a this we're just at the start of this, Tommy. Like this is going to change drastically how we think about and how we build things. Tools will be built on top of this. This is going to really revolutionize what we do. And now the emphasis, you still need smart people to figure out what to build because the AI is not going to know what to build, but you're going to need

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2870s" target="_blank">47:50</a> Really smart people to figure out how to orchestrate what you're building. I'm seeing this in software development. How long till this comes to data engineering? When when do we get an AI like right now? I see AI building experiences inside the notebook. I see AI building experiences inside the report, right? We see standalone co-pilot experiences talking with data agents, right? We see ontology showing up. All these things feel like AI is in a part of the product. Where's the AI to build the entire product,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2905s" target="_blank">48:25</a> Tommy? Right? Like, hey, co-pilot or whatever the thing is, build me a pipeline. This pipeline should have these actions. Here's the string to connect to the SQL database. Go look at this table, this table, this table. go decide how we should load the tables and literally with AI plan out what you're going to do. Okay, I found table one. I did some research. It looks like you should incrementally load it. Okay, do it. Like you decide AI, right? I don't want to pick the right tool. I don't want to pick the tool. Let the AI pick

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2937s" target="_blank">48:57</a> It. Should I be using a copy job on this? Is that going to be easier for me to manage? Should I be dropping it into a pipeline? Should it come in through a notebook? I don't know. AI figure it out. And then the AI should be good enough to figure out, okay, it's going to build the task. Okay, table one, I'm going to load it here. Table two and three can be loaded the same way. I'm going to build a metadata driven pipeline inside a inside a data factory pipeline inside u, fabric or a pipeline, right? And here you go. I built it for you and then at the end I get to review all the things it created and tweak them to my needs. How like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=2972s" target="_blank">49:32</a> When will this is not far away. So it's funny though too because now my Twitter feed is like oh you search or like clicked on a lot of things about cloud code so that's the only thing we're going to show you and it's very overwhelming with some of these tools too and I think I think I imagine people out there look at fabric the way I I look at AI because I am not the one with like the AI space in a sense building the AI itself, but I'm using it and you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3008s" target="_blank">50:08</a> Know I it just seems like an it seems like a well that just never ends that continues to go down no matter how far I want to go down with learning AI or using the tools there's always going to be more than I could consume and I think about fabric and I especially for organizations who are just getting introduced to this I have a feeling Mike that they look at fabric and they're just getting started with data and they can see it the same way where it's like oh notebooks and okay the lakehouse

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3043s" target="_blank">50:43</a> Wait is this are we data engineering right now what happened to just reporting what happened to just a semantic model and getting people to view data what is all this other things and especially I think Microsoft's done a great job with the UI for what it's worth Mike to let's not, under state that they've really put six different applications, six different careers, and they crammed it into one location. And I think they did did a pretty good job. But I think

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3076s" target="_blank">51:16</a> That's why they try to use the word experience a lot is because they're trying very hard for you when you're doing notebooks that you're doing notebooks. and that it's great for a developer who's done it for years and also for someone who's just starting. Mike, I had to update my blog site and I know actually it was a tool that my other older company used and when I logged in to try to just get started with it, it wasn't anything like complex, but the way this application

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3113s" target="_blank">51:53</a> Built everything, I didn't know where to go for settings. There was no help buttons. It was no way I didn't even know how to ask a question. It was very frustrating. , and I think right now that experience that Microsoft's trying to have us have is at least being I know where I am and it feels familiar in some way. And I think when we're talking about experiences, especially with data, go to AWS, dude, or go to their control panel. That's terrible. I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3146s" target="_blank">52:26</a> Hate that. because that's a bad experience. You better know where you're going. I would also argue I've spent a copious amount of time on Amazon.com just trying to find the share button for something. Like I found a product that I'm I bought and someone's like, "Hey, what did you buy?" I'm like, "I bought this product." It was quite difficult to just go find the button to go share the product with somebody else inside Amazon. So agree Tommy like the experience like how you feel when you you use a part of the product, how you feel when you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3180s" target="_blank">53:00</a> Implement some of these things. I think that's really really useful. I think a lot of emphasis is now talking about experience. But this is the same stuff like there's no I think it's just a fad. The word that word and how it's being used is just been a fad of like just heavily used right now. It's been around for the whole time. we talk about UI, UX, like that's been I think more of a studied field and I think experience is a way of you generalizing it a bit more and not putting in the hands of like the designer, right? The designer doesn't need to do that. if I can go over to Figma and AI AI my way into

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3215s" target="_blank">53:35</a> This. Let me let me step back here one one moment, Tommy. One thing that you were talking while you were talking I had a thought and I thought this a couple times now which is when you are now programming we we have met we have come to the place where programming is now what you speak that is the ultimate programming language right it's it's if I can type words in English the way I speak right to an AI and the AI can interpret them and and build code off of those words.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3251s" target="_blank">54:11</a> We've just moved the programming language away from writing Java, TypeScript, whatever the thing is. We've now moved it into just naturally speaking to the computer. And I think I think this is where we stop. Like I don't think there's any more evolution to talking to machines or computers other than using your natural language to tell it to do stuff or tell it to build stuff. We we're finished. Now what happens is to your point Tommy we just make the AI better at interpreting like what you said we're now starting to work on the tooling to make it easier for you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3284s" target="_blank">54:44</a> To work with it right this is where Ralphie comes from Ralphie comes from this this space Ralph Wigs is this tool that helps an AI make a task list and then burn through the tasks well now who's going to make the task list well now I'm going to use AI to help me build a really rich task list of all the things I need to create yeah that makes sense to So, this is where I'm at right now, Tommy. Like, this whole new world of programming has just moved from writing code to speaking to the computer, and we're still programming. It's just done in a more comfortable

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3320s" target="_blank">55:20</a> Language. Okay. So, do you think we have an experience problem in fabric? I I'm going to say this. I don't know the answer to that one, Tommy. What I will say though is I don't necessarily think we have an experience problem. I think we have my opinion is I think we have an attention problem per se. Okay. Right. I I think the attention problem is and this is a problem that any I think large organization has problem

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3352s" target="_blank">55:52</a> Struggles with. Right Tommy? Do you build a new feature that garnishes more users to show up to your product or do you refine and clean and polish the existing features that are there? Who are you listening to? Right. Are you listening to your existed users? I think there's a very I feel like there's a there's a lot of variety in how you look at this, right? If you if you want to drive for new exciting things, you build new features. That that's just what you do. But if you want to retain your existing customers

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3384s" target="_blank">56:24</a> And make them happy about what they're building, you focus on existing features, refining them, making them more polished. But in that way, you're not really generating new revenue by doing that. That's almost like a a a cost of doing business. And at some point, the software gets so large that you're just maintaining and you're not able to really actually edit and create new features. And some of those older features that you liked [clears throat] goals, right? Metric sets, right? Some of those things you got to let them go. No one uses them. It was a neat idea. It was, it was sold to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3417s" target="_blank">56:57</a> The business as a good idea here and it didn't really land, right? So, you had to cut and run, move on to other things, even though some people may have liked it or used it. Does that make sense? Yeah. I think as we go to the tail end here, we're going to keep seeing it. I don't think it's going to go away and the focus on what an experience is. I I will tie it in with his with [clears throat] definition of an experience. Every time I log into my computer, it is a whether or not it's a significant

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3451s" target="_blank">57:31</a> Experience. not something that's going to necessarily be saved in the core memory, but when Mike, I was building a notebook yesterday. I was trying someone's open- source repository. it was like, "Hey, done a local model." And I was trying to do it in Google Collab, which is like Google's market for like notebooks. and I was just thinking to myself, I complain about fabric notebooks because I I wish I had a more of a desktop experience, desktop experience, but trying to use

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3485s" target="_blank">58:05</a> Google Collab is terrible. Even though it's their own kernel and it goes, it's super fast. I'm like I love the ability and I think whenever we're dealing with technology regardless if it's fabric data or just in general the last thing I think we need and is worrying about where to click to your point where the share button is and I think is my life better because the workflow and fabric yeah I'm more developer

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3520s" target="_blank">58:40</a> Focused So there's other things that I do like off it, but when I'm thinking of the experience of a new organization or the experience of a user getting into fabric and getting introduced. Yep. Yeah. I think it's it's it's the right way and I think you have to set it as an experience or or say the word experience. I think it's just what they're using right now. I think we've been doing experiences all all along. It's been called UIUX. It's been called other things. I I I agree with this article, Tommy, or the the comment here from the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3554s" target="_blank">59:14</a> Mailbag. I think the word is overused. Everything is the word experience. Experience this, experience that, experience this. Everyone's trying to evoke an emotion and the product has gotten so large, everyone's using experiences. Instead of just saying the word deliver, [laughter] right? where's where's my pivot table from Excel inside PowerBI? Where's my table slicer that I really want? like where's what what are we doing to improve the usability of the filter pane, right? Those are the let's let's improve those experiences. Let's make that smoother, right? And and yes,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3589s" target="_blank">59:49</a> I agree like it's probably overused, but at the end of the day, you're going to be invoking some emotion from the developer or the user that's going to be using something the developer built. Yeah. Awesome. All right, dude. This is good. I Hey, what? Our mailbags are usually so like, tech driven. This is a good one. So, yes, guys, we're me and Mike were going through the mailbags last week and I'm amazed how many people are writing. So, please please keep sending us

[1:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzfU7RjqIM&t=3622s) Mailbags and even if it's something like this, I don't think he even mentioned a particular part of fabric at all. which is neat. But dude, pretty cool. Yes, also agree there. Tommy, thank you all much very much for listening to the podcast. We hope you've enjoyed this hour with us talking about some new news, going through some experience-based things that we've seen. pay attention to what's going on in your PowerBI tenant.
