## News & Announcements

### The SaaS Apocalypse Is Here

Peter's viral article on how "11 free plugins exposed tech's biggest lie" sent shockwaves through enterprise software. Anthropic's Claude Code released plugins that connect to Excel, Word, and PowerPoint—doing what many expected Microsoft to build themselves. The market reaction was brutal:

- **Thomson Reuters** — Down 18% in a single day, 33% year-to-date
- **LegalZoom** — Down 20%
- **Salesforce** — Down 26% year-to-date
- **HubSpot** — Down 39% year-to-date
- **Atlassian** — Down 35% year-to-date
- **DocuSign** — Down 52% over 12 months, 85% from all-time high

Mike's take: "These $100-200/month AI tools have changed how people work. If you're not already using AI, you're in a competitive race—and falling behind."

### AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It

- [Harvard Business Review: AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it) — This HBR article explores the counterintuitive reality that AI doesn't lighten workloads—it amplifies them. While AI handles drafting documents, summarizing information, and debugging code, workers find themselves multitasking more intensely and managing AI agents alongside their regular responsibilities. Mike confirms: "I am physically working more intensely than ever before."

### Semantic Link Now Generally Available

Semantic Link has graduated from beta to GA in Microsoft Fabric. Built largely by Michael Kowalski and the community, this tool enables data scientists to use semantic models directly in notebooks. It's become a Swiss Army knife for:

- Automating Power BI tasks against semantic models
- Translating and migrating workloads
- SQL and Spark integrations

Mike's advice: "Microsoft should focus on API-first development. Build the infrastructure, let developers create on top of it—that's where you stay relevant."

### Excel/CSV Import Deprecation

The old Excel and CSV import experience in Power BI Service is being retired:
- **May 2026** — Reports from the old experience stop refreshing
- **July 2026** — No data syncing

This is a good cleanup—we have lakehouses, OneLake, and Dataflows Gen 2 now. Time to modernize those legacy workflows.

## Main Discussion: Trusting Microsoft Fabric

After 500+ episodes talking about Power BI and two years with Fabric, do we trust it?

### The Verdict: Yes, But It Took Time

Tommy and Mike agree: Fabric has matured significantly in the last 3-6 months. The rough edges from the GA release have been smoothed out. The day-to-day experience—Git integration, notebook workflows, lakehouse operations—just works now.

**Mike's trust list:**
- ✅ Spark and Python notebooks — "By far my go-to. The notebook experience is top-notch."
- ✅ Lakehouse — Solid foundation for data engineering
- ✅ SQL Database — "Works like a normal SQL database. I'm actually building web apps on top of it."
- ✅ Pay-as-you-go Spark (Autoscale) — Flexible pricing, no limits on cluster size

**Tommy's trust list:**
- ✅ Lakehouse — "The number one area where I'm finding source of truth."
- ✅ Git integration — "The things that were buggy before just work now."
- ✅ Direct Lake — Building semantic models this way is the preferred workflow

### The Friction Points

**Copilot:** Both hosts find the in-Fabric Copilot experience lacking. "Every time I see Copilot show up, it doesn't quite do what I want." The pricing/licensing model is confusing, and they often use free browser-based AI tools instead.

**Service Principals:** Item ownership in Fabric is still built around individual users. "I want the service principal of the workspace to create and own the items—not individual users."

**Connections:** Setting up connections properly requires more expertise than the Power BI days.

**Real-time/Webhooks:** "There's nowhere in Fabric where you can turn on a webhook with basic authentication." For event-driven applications, you still need an Azure Function as middleware.

### Who Thrives with Fabric?

- **Data-curious teams** that blend data engineering and BI analysis
- **Organizations with leadership** that views data as a strategic asset
- **Teams already comfortable** with federated, collaborative approaches

### Who Struggles?

- **Small businesses** (under 25 people) — The ramp-up time and complexity may not be worth it
- **Excel-centric organizations** — There's a significant trust jump from local Excel macros to cloud-based notebooks
- **Highly centralized IT teams** — If everything must go through a single team, Fabric's self-service model creates friction

### The Bottom Line

"You can trust Fabric. There's a price point for any organization at any scale. But you have to learn it and think about how to improve your business differently."

## FabCon 2026 Announcement

Mike will be speaking at **Microsoft FabCon** in Atlanta, March 16-20, 2026. It's a combined SQL and Fabric conference—expected to be a big show. Register at [fabriccon.com](https://fabriccon.com).

And yes, Mike debuted a new AI-generated song called "Expense It" about expense reports and FabCon travel. It's on Spotify under PowerBI.tips. 🎵

And that that energy high energy then I've been uh exploring what would then I've been uh exploring it sound like. So one thing what it would sound like. is guitar solos, Tommy. I like is I like guitar solos, rock and roll. heavy stuff. But I rock and roll. I like don't any of the lyrics on any of don't like any of the this really literally could this stuff. I really I just give me huge drums, just just give me like massive guitars, and solo upon solo massive guitars, and just solo solo. So I've also built another upon solo. So I've also album called Silicon Metal. Yeah. Made album called Silicon Metal. Yeah. by AI. by AI. &gt;&gt; And is making it what would metal music without what I would call metal any lyrics. So can listen to it all any lyrics. So I can day long as much as I want and just get day long as much as that energy through the roof. Anyways, that energy through the roof. I'm having so fun right now. AI is I'm having so much fun incredible. blast. All incredible. I'm having a blast. right, let's get into our well news right, let's get into our here. But before do that, let's um go here. But before we do what main topic will be today into what our main topic is just talking about do we trust is just talking about do fabric? We've been episode 500. We've fabric? We've been at episode for well over been talking about fabric for two years now. Uh how does it look? What two years now. Uh how what feel it? what does it what do are there any friction points? Is it Uh are there any friction getting better? What's our trust level getting better? What's our trust fabric? How if you're a new user and in fabric? How if you're like I'm not quite sure about you're like I'm not quite fabric. Where do we go from here? So we fabric. Where do we go are going to definitely dive in a bit are going to definitely dive more this topic and talk more about more in this topic and what find that's working for us in do we fabric. Let's how trust it fabric. Let's talk about how areas we're not trusting as much. So or areas we're not trusting let's we'll dive into that in a little let's we'll dive into that bit. jump some news articles. Let's Tommy, I got fun ones today. I Tommy, I got some fun believe believe &gt;&gt; do that. &gt;&gt; I I do that. Okay, I'm going throw down a &gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going couple links here. One of them is al is couple links here. One of on Twitter and don't even know how to on Twitter and I don't say name this article. Uh but say the name of this Peter, can name. So Peter is Peter, I can say his talking about his name and Peter is SAS apocalypse. SAS apocalypse. Sassalypse. don't know Sassalypse. SAS apocalypse. I don't how he says it in the article. It sounds how he says it in like um Anyways, won't get it right. like um Anyways, I I

**[4:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=241s)**

like um Anyways, I I won't get it right. How 11 free plugins exposed tech's How 11 free plugins exposed biggest lie is kind of the article here. biggest lie is kind of And um found this article to be very I interesting. Yeah. Okay. So really the interesting. Yeah. Okay. So really premise Anthropic one our our here lovely AI agent person out there. lovely AI agent person out building Claude Code. Anthropic is building Claude Code. That's kind of parent company of That's kind of the the what we use all the time. Tommy, you what we use all the love Cloud You've seen a lot of Code. that. I play with it a bit. Their that. I play with it models. Opus is one that I use heavily. models. Opus is one that Um, but since the release, they released Um, but since the release, uh plugin basically connects to a uh plugin basically that of Microsoft's products. It's in all of Microsoft's products. It's Excel, it's Word, PowerPoint. Excel, it's in Word, it's And think there's like an elephant in And I think there's like room around this. People are the room here around this. finding incredibly valuable and finding this is incredibly valuable wondering to themselves, why didn't wondering to themselves, why didn't Microsoft just release this? What Microsoft just release this? What happened? So there's whole idea of happened? So there's this whole like has kind like Microsoft has this like very, you know, longstanding security very, you know, longstanding security everything that's got to move quick and everything that's got to with through all these with through security all these different levels. Yeah, I agree. I different levels. Yeah, I agree. understand. But cloud code shows up, understand. But cloud code shows builds plugin, drops into your builds a plugin, drops into existing tooling, oh my word, it's existing tooling, and oh my saving people tons of times all over the saving people tons of times place can things at very rapid build rates. rates. Let I'll just say something here, Let me I'll just say Tommy. This company that Tommy. This is a company understands the importance of creation, understands the importance of creation, working with expert the importance of working with helping them build something. That's and helping them build something. where AI is really good at. It's good at where AI is really good building things doing repetitive building things and doing repetitive tasks time. don't want AI to the autogenerate bunch of insights go autogenerate me a bunch or that should be thinking or things that I should about. produce most about. I want the AI about. I want the AI the content, right? Go build these files. go content, right? Go build these mundane things. to tell build the mundane things. I it what want, but it should just go it what I want, but it. build it. &gt;&gt; You are bringing up I have a great news &gt;&gt; You are bringing up article for next week. Um, I just found article for next week. Um,

**[6:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=362s)**

article for next week. Um, I just found it. It was all over in terms of it. It was all over basically what's happening now too. And basically what's happening now too. honestly, not with the coding and I so honestly, not with the coding much more than just coding now with the much more than just coding building of things. before it was like building of things. before it yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah A could help but you're we're finding for could help but you're we're most developers they would have to admit most developers they would have today that today that AI does better than them at a faster AI does it better than rate um and think yes so the article's rate um and I think name is something big is happening and name is something big is basically idea here if you do basically the idea here is remember when uh co the corona virus hit remember when uh co the like two months before it got and real real like &gt;&gt; yeah this seems like something but I'm I &gt;&gt; yeah this seems like don't know, you're like, "It's not don't know, you're like, "It's around me." And just kind of around me." And you just thinking some people were over, you thinking some people were over, uh, it was overblown, yada know, yada. that phase of, yada yada. And that kind &gt;&gt; yeah, I don't think it's going to be a &gt;&gt; yeah, I don't think big deal. obviously, was big deal. And obviously, it deal. And this Yeah, ahead. saying this &gt;&gt; this Yeah, go ahead. lead going to very well my next article. Keep in very well to my going, Tommy. going, Tommy. Okay. Yeah. really if you've been And working AI at all, but I think working in AI at all, especially thank goodness we're not just especially thank goodness we're not only developers, only developers, but at all if you've been utilizing AI, you've seen this been utilizing AI, you've seen rapid incredible uh know growth not rapid incredible uh you know just ability to talk to you but just in this ability to what can do and you know that is what it can do and where things are really occurring now where things are really occurring it's happening so fast where it's happening so fast &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and yes &gt;&gt; yes I'll pause there. Yeah. So, in this &gt;&gt; I'll pause there. Yeah. article, talks about market article, it talks about the reckoning. fact that $100 reckoning. So, the fact that or $200 month tool has been released, or $200 a month tool Claude Code, Co-work, this Claude Code, Claude Co-work, this tooling now existing tooling is now existing in the marketplace. It took a lot of sassified marketplace. It took a lot programs companies and they took a programs or companies and they massive hit. Let me give you some of the massive hit. Let me give names. Thompson Vers uh went down 18% in names. Thompson Vers uh went single day has been down 33% year and to date. Legal Zoom down 20%. Um, year to date. Legal Zoom

**[8:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=485s)**

year to date. Legal Zoom down 20%. Um, some of the other big ones here, some of the other big Salesforce 26%, HubSpot 39% Salesforce down 26%, HubSpot down year-to- Alassian 35% year-to- date. Alassian down 35% Docuine 52% over 12 months. date. Docuine 52% down over 85% from alltime high. ASA 59 60% 85% down from alltime high. These are crazy down over 12 months. These numbers, Tommy. And what I think is numbers, Tommy. And what I happening here these tools were happening here is these tools around buy our seat, we'll give you a around buy our seat, we'll software product that would be very software product that would be difficult for make. That's that's difficult for you to make. the principle here. And so these this the principle here. And so cloud code and all these new AI agents cloud code and all these are just now entering the market. We're are just now entering the hitting again we're still in the just hitting again we're still early waves of this. It's coming in and early waves of this. It's it's changing how people work on things. it's changing how people work saw Super Bowl ad talking about I I saw a Super Bowl don't remember what company it was, but don't remember what company it they're building web apps they're talking about building web or right inside their or building apps right inside office. office. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. We talked about that. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. We This no this new concept. This &gt;&gt; This is no this has been around like power apps, power has been around like power pages have forever pages have been around forever business users to build things with low business users to build things no code solutions. It's just that we or no code solutions. It's went the uh 11th degree. just went to the uh We're we're we've upshifted a We're we're on we're we've gear here and now we can do all this gear here and now we stuff with AI which is incredible. So stuff with AI which is anyways, thought article was anyways, I thought this article interesting. Um basically how do interesting. Um it basically was you defend against some of these you defend against some of companies that are being hit hard by AI. companies that are being hit would argue if not already I would argue if you using AI, think this way it's a so competitive race, right? Your company competitive race, right? Your company needs people to do something. There's needs people to do something. can't get rid of everyone's job at a you because then there'd no one company because then there'd be left um anything. And I think left um to do anything. that's not good reasonable explanation that's not a good reasonable of what will happen with AI. Um there's of what will happen with some experiments being made now with a some experiments being made now company called Macrohard where they can company called Macrohard where they build entire from AI agents. build the entire company from Ah, don't know. We'll see how it turns Ah, I don't know. We'll out. Proof will be in the pudding, I out. Proof will be in think. However, if you're think. However, I think if looking at race here against you and looking at a race here everyone else your company, everyone else at your company, &gt;&gt; the people that are going to hang around &gt;&gt; the people that are longest ones the longest are the ones understanding how use AI and the understanding how to use AI couple cases or couple use cases or a I've seen really adopting and bringing I've seen really adopting and

**[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=606s)**

I've seen really adopting and bringing AI to the forefront of what they're AI to the forefront of doing. doing. &gt;&gt; They're building many applications. &gt;&gt; They're building many applications. agentic like stuff They're building AI agentic like with their code. not afraid of with their code. They're not to step in, right? They're bu code to step in, right? they're stepping into problems in the they're stepping into problems in company and solving by building company and solving problems by solutions around them. They're solvers. So I think for me what I'm solvers. So I think for looking here is like look there's looking at here is like going to be this going to be this wave of AI. You better embrace it. It's wave of AI. You better coming whether you or not. And coming whether you like it your goal should learn how it works. your goal should be learn Figure out to build many products, Figure out how to build applications, web apps, little things applications, web apps, little things that tools help do your job that tools that help you better. better. &gt;&gt; And that's one. I think it's fun to &gt;&gt; And that's one. I create stuff like this. I just really create stuff like this. I enjoy it. So, super neat. enjoy it. So, I think But addition that, you got to be But in addition to that, the one company showing the one at the company is people, building stuff, creating new people, building stuff, creating new things, solving problems with these things, solving problems with these kinds of tools. And then I think then kinds of tools. And then you're indestructible because why would you're indestructible because why would they let go if you're building they let you go if things and solving problems, things and solving problems, &gt;&gt; right? Well, &gt;&gt; right? Well, with AI, that's coming &gt;&gt; with the AI, the like have companies need AI you integrators. Like I'm already seeing it integrators. Like I'm already seeing my business. having lot more in my business. I'm having conversations around demos and things conversations around demos and things how integrate AI into and how to integrate AI applications appdev development with applications and appdev development with PowerBI. PowerBI. &gt;&gt; Mike, mean, we're really just getting &gt;&gt; Mike, I mean, we're the point again, think we're to going be monitoring this more just going to be monitoring and more. I'm save and more. I I really article for next week, but our the dreams what's possible closer to us dreams what's possible is closer than never before. But at the than never than ever before. same time, you almost feel relevant, same time, you almost feel too, because too, because there's, know, I don't want to use there's, you know, I don't word disruption. never lived in the word disruption. I never Silicon Valley, but my gosh, Mike, I'm Silicon Valley, but my gosh, doing stuff throughout day where doing stuff throughout my day would have to hire someone. I would I would have to hire multiple people. could have to hire multiple people. replace myself for it replace myself for it &gt;&gt; like and there are things that I'm doing &gt;&gt; like and there are now now that used find writing to documentation researching tending documentation or researching I'm tending

**[12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=727s)**

documentation or researching I'm tending to done to done &gt;&gt; and it's better which is the crazy &gt;&gt; and it's done better thing. just you got me inspired. I thing. I just um you created skill for how I write just created a skill for my contracts because my contracts and because I do markdown. markdown. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yep. I'm like wonder know. Listen listen &gt;&gt; I'm like I wonder listen. Good. listen. Good. doing the same thing exactly as you &gt;&gt; I'm doing the same speak right Keep going. I I love now. this. this. I'm doing the exact my business well cuz I told you my business as well cuz Tommy, write everything can as much Tommy, write everything you can can. Don't use any word docs. as you can. Don't use Just Mark. Just write everything in Mark. &gt;&gt; So, since I already have all these &gt;&gt; So, since I already markdown files and they have a format markdown files and they have like wonder told uh Claude, I'm like I wonder and I like, "Hey, build me a skill. Here's my like, "Hey, build me a repo um you know, of all my uh repo um you know, of contracts." And it's pretty awesome, contracts." And it's pretty awesome, dude. So, dude. So, &gt;&gt; and also what with AI and stuff like &gt;&gt; and and also what this, you can actually build yourself this, you can actually build client estimator tool, right? like a a client estimator Really fast. Hey, here is my transcript Really fast. Hey, here is from the meeting. Here's the summary from the meeting. Here's the cat chat JP Copilot. Here's all of from cat chat JP Copilot. historical statements work. The my bot can have access to all these the bot can have access things. It knows and it can read through things. It knows and it everything get context for whatever everything and get context for needs right there. Boom. Read it all all. This incredible. And so I think all. This is incredible. And if with adding inside your markdown if with adding so inside file area, Tommy, what you should file area, Tommy, what you probably have probably do is you should bot go through and write down an a a bot go through agent.mmd say summarize all my agent.mmd file and say summarize old workers of statement. What types of old workers of statement. What activities key exercises were done? activities or key exercises were Build out company profile based on my Build out a company profile past work. do? And then when past work. What do we you ask to build a new statement of it work, can go there, read that first, work, it can go there, and understand, okay, these are the then projects we've done with different projects that we've done with skills. I look those files and skills. I can go look get information directly from them and get information directly from them draw put into new draw from them and put statement of work. This is gamecher for statement of work. This is me. me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, um I could keep talking about &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, um I this. this. All right, let's move to the next one. &gt;&gt; All right, let's move there are more things to &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let's there talk about surprisingly. talk about surprisingly.

**[14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=847s)**

talk about surprisingly. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to this other article I've &gt;&gt; So, let's go to got here. another one from Harvard got here. I got another Business Reviewed. AI doesn't reduce Business Reviewed. AI doesn't reduce work, it intensifies this. I'm gonna go work, it intensifies this. I'm back to article, Tommy. We've back to this article, Tommy. already talked about one once already talked about this one before. I've twice now. I am before. I I've read it very convinced that true very convinced that this is statement. Um, and article is statement. Um, and this this really good. just want to bring it up really good. I just want again. feel like I'm working more again. I feel like I'm intensely on things than ever before. intensely on things than ever multitasking bit more. giving I'm multitasking a bit more. agents and bots to do things on the agents and bots to do side. can focus my attention on side. I I can focus something, have something, have it the agent or solve then move on to the next solve it and then move thing. can't go argue enough thing. I can't go I for this article. It's really good. I for this article. It's really like it. think how I am like it. I think this physically working on stuff. So, I'll physically working on stuff. So, just leave that one there. Tommy, just I'll leave that one you got some articles, too. you got some articles, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. mean, if you guys have not &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I mean, seen it, will be in the podcast seen it, it will be description. This this may be a description. This is this may series, article, actually, Mike. series, this article, actually, Mike. So, So, &gt;&gt; supercharge. Read title. the Let's let's hear it. Let's let's hear it. Um, no, I'm saying the article that &gt;&gt; Um, no, I'm saying you're talking about again, the AI you're talking about again, the doesn't um supercharge. We may have to doesn't um supercharge. We may make series of that. make a series out of &gt;&gt; think right &gt;&gt; I think you're right about They're Anyways, we got two PowerBI and &gt;&gt; They're Anyways, we got fabric articles. So the first one is fabric articles. So the first semantic link baby now generally semantic link baby is now available Microsoft fabric. this available in Microsoft fabric. So something that has been available. It is something that has been was beta but it is in GA and was in beta but now semantic link simply created to you semantic link was simply created know um enable data scientists use know um enable data scientists models directly notebooks semantic models directly in notebooks which something that I I've always which is something that I touted for. Everyone wants the um touted for. Everyone always wants developer experience of raw the developer experience of the data. But why? Because you never had a data. But why? Because you nice connect structured nice way to connect to We can automate PowerBI task in semantic We can automate PowerBI task link uh against models, link uh against semantic models, translate the and even migrate translate the models and even workloads. There's data engineering workloads. There's a uh data operations can use for SQL operations can use semantic link spark tests um links and spark t tests and built by really the community and led by built by really the community Michael Kovalski no Kowalsski Michael Kovalski no Kowalsski

**[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=969s)**

Michael Kovalski no Kowalsski &gt;&gt; Kovalsski K &gt;&gt; Kovalsski K I'll say it go ahead &gt;&gt; Michael Kovalski I'll say yeah so they're really leaning into this &gt;&gt; yeah so they're really even though even though you know was one of their employees it who just focused that's who really just focused on usually when Microsoft most usually when Microsoft the most successful successful &gt;&gt; there's difference Tommy. So this &gt;&gt; there's a difference here um you're talking about semantic link is um you're talking about labs labs which project. This &gt;&gt; which is a project. link. Semantic about semantic link. Semantic link part of the product and semantic link part of the product and feeder for what features are labs being used most that gets sent over to being used most that gets actual object. So the actual semantic link object. is like library you semantic link is like a can just go use. This is great. I'm can just go use. This happy this becoming fully supported. happy this is becoming fully It does so many things and it's doing It does so many things across not the model side just Tommy. model, Tommy. is doing things across fabric API report side, like it's the fabric API report side, things. It's really doing so many things. It's good Swiss Army knife. And to be to be good Swiss Army knife. And honest, Tommy, this what Microsoft honest, Tommy, this is what should working on. should be working on. Microsoft tooling like this, be working on tooling like building things that aid. So, a lot of building things that aid. So, times we have of, you know, times we have a lot Microsoft spends ton UI, UX Microsoft spends a ton of development, user experience. Okay, you development, user experience. Okay, you get some that stuff right. But the get some of that stuff strength is having an Microsoft atscale atscale rockolid API layer lets you do rockolid API layer that lets anything want to build. Let the take anything you want to build. mentality what you've the take the mentality of been doing for years, Microsoft. You've been doing for years, Microsoft. letting people software on been letting people build software top your products years. That's top of your products for exactly what should continue doing. exactly what you should continue Build the APIs, Build the APIs, build the infrastructure, everything has infrastructure, build everything has to be an first mentality. If you can do be an API first mentality. that and bring things like semantic that and bring things like link, which are tools, all that does is link, which are tools, all enable developers build more creative enable developers to build more what they need. You will stay tools to what they need. relevant longer by having all this relevant longer by having all stuff. And now, Tommy, I'm using bots. I stuff. And now, Tommy, I'm have agent here computer that have an agent here on helping me create items and artifacts is fabric. Like actually doing in fabric. Like I'm I'm I've given access. It's allowed to I've given it access. It's

**[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1090s)**

I've given it access. It's allowed to talk to the APIs. It can make me a talk to the APIs. It notebook. say, "Hey, agent, go notebook. I can say, "Hey, build and put this process build me a notebook and in notebook." writes whole in the notebook." It writes thing Python. thing in Python. &gt;&gt; Here's how to connect. Here's how to do &gt;&gt; Here's how to connect. transformations. All cells are the transformations. All the cells written and documents whole thing written and it documents the me. So then I can go through and for me. So then I make tweaks to after the fact and see make tweaks to it after what wrote test it. But this is what it wrote and test incredible, Tommy. Just alone having the incredible, Tommy. Just alone having ability do that awesome. ability to do that is &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they they have actually really &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they they taken official semantic links and taken the official semantic links they've lot from labs they've actually taken a lot too. So it is nice to see that. It too. So it is nice really is. really is. &gt;&gt; love it. It's really good. &gt;&gt; I love it. It's All right, you got one more. &gt;&gt; All right, you got Finally, something sad. &gt;&gt; Finally, something sad. There's another deprecation that has &gt;&gt; There's another deprecation that come our way. come our way. They took away natural Q&amp;A &gt;&gt; They took away our and now we have more. Yeah. So &gt;&gt; and now we have of the old Excel and CSV deprecation import experience into PowerBI. So this import experience into PowerBI. So has been around since the very beginning has been around since the now it's gone. files Excel and are um really removing that ability to are um really removing that import uh into PowerBI service. Um import uh into the PowerBI by May of end of May of this year by May of at the reports building from old the reports that building from experience will stop refreshing in July. experience will stop refreshing in Um there be just no data that's Um there will be just syncing. So if you want to create a syncing. So the if you report, it's really get data report, it's really that get experience. experience. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So I'm okay with this honestly. We've got &gt;&gt; I'm okay with this we've fabric now. we've got fabric now. We've lake. places to put files. I lake. We've got places to can still use data flows gen 2 to go can still use data flows read the from SharePoint from read the file from SharePoint Lakehouse. don't really care. I'm not Lakehouse. I don't really care. too worried about this one. This this too worried about this one. me just feels like it's been one to me just feels slowly dying anyways and people are just slowly dying anyways and people going use less less. So I going to use it less think this good deprecation. I'm think this is a good not too worried about it. Do you not I'm not too worried have anything, Tommy, that you have the have anything, Tommy, that you Are using process today that's Are you using a process this feature right now, using this feature right now, &gt;&gt; Mike? I not touched these in so have

**[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1210s)**

&gt;&gt; Mike? I have not touched these in so long. I used to really try those once long. I used to really like, "Oh, this cool." But yeah, like, "Oh, this is cool." &gt;&gt; there's my point. &gt;&gt; there's my point. mean, Microsoft, they're going &gt;&gt; I mean, Microsoft, they're through um and they've been cleaning through um and they've been house with lot legacy house with a lot of products. products. That's good. Let's get rid of the stuff &gt;&gt; that you don't want to maintain. Let's that you don't want to off those features. get you off of those deprecate them. Get out the door. deprecate them. Get them out focus what we're good at. Make Let's more APIs. build better more APIs. Let's build better experiences. like this. This is good. experiences. I like this. This I'm okay with one. This one This I'm okay with this one. feels to me. one feels good to me. bad deprecation in any way, but is a a bad deprecation call out. If you have it is good to call something you're using it, it will no something you're using on it, longer work. longer work. &gt;&gt; For the first time, we're seeing a lot &gt;&gt; For the first time, more things being removed than I think more things being removed than added. And it's good. I think we're just added. And it's good. I really different direction. So really move a different direction. &gt;&gt; maybe would argue Tommy like the the &gt;&gt; I I maybe would richness of features or the richness of the features the spans that fabric can spans of the features that provide. think it's pretty complete. provide. I think it's pretty You've got real time, you've got You've got real time, you've pipelines, um know all pipelines, you've got um you the databases that Microsoft supports the databases that Microsoft supports and uses. They're available. They're and uses. They're all available. they're kind ecosystem they're kind of in the now inside fabric. I don't think we need inside fabric. I don't think more things. Swiss Army knife is more things. The Swiss Army full. have all tools that I the want. What we're doing now, I think, is want. What we're doing now, sharpening them, right? We're making sharpening them, right? We're making honing edges. it we're honing the edges. We're more effective. that's I'm more effective. I think that's liking this. like next stage of liking this. I like this like, okay, not trying to, you we we're know, Gartner our way into another know, Gartner our way into feature. [laughter] So, there's like a feature. [laughter] So, there's like term, this term, you know, this is feature, right? This has to be a feature feature, right? This has to we have for Gartner review every we have for the Gartner year. I think we've got all the features year. I think we've got that need. Now, it's just refining that we need. Now, it's those and making them more those features and making them seamlessly integrated together. seamlessly integrated together. I think that's where we're starting to see that's where we're starting to things move, which is exciting. All things move, which is exciting. right, being said, Tommy, let's get right, that being said, Tommy, into our main topic. So our main topic into our main topic. So today trusting Microsoft fabric. today is trusting in Microsoft &gt;&gt; Where do you want to take this &gt;&gt; Where do you want conversation today? How conversation today? How do you how pitch this? how do you want to Yeah, there's few things as I was &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a few going through and just kind of thinking going through and just kind about what does it mean to trust about what does it mean something? And I took it really something? And I think I on the landscape how we looked at of PowerBI beginning. Um has our PowerBI in the beginning. Um

**[22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1330s)**

PowerBI in the beginning. Um has our trust changed from the beginning where trust changed from the beginning is something reliable? Is it something is something reliable? Is it that can used multiple scenarios? that can be used in you know, small business, enterprise, you know, small business, enterprise, individual. individual. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. Um, dependable? terms of it the things I needed to do and that honestly, question really honestly, the question that I want ask more than ever is, do we want to ask more than have same um, optimistic outlook to have the same um, optimistic Microsoft Fabric did with PowerBI Microsoft Fabric as we did when came out? when it came out? &gt;&gt; Good question. So, let me let's talk &gt;&gt; Good question. So, let about your first kind of points here, about your first kind of right? You said, um, where do you use right? You said, um, where it? we see it? kind of where do fitting inside the spectrum of it fitting inside the spectrum things? Is going to fit the small, things? Is it going to medium, or large businesses? Let's start medium, or large businesses? Let's there. I'm say yes. I feel that there. I'm going to say business. pay for fabric, small but use smaller SKUs. It's very but I use the smaller affordable. get lot of value out of affordable. I get a lot it. helps me with my standard it. It helps me with reporting, I'm not running into any reporting, and I'm not running limits. Now, do have to be careful. I limits. Now, I do have can't go out build crazy big jobs, can't go out and build but also am small business. I don't but I also am a tons of volume data. It's have crazy tons of volume just not required. So, I can get away just not required. So, I with low lower-end skew, which I with a low a lower-end think is affordable. That's the point of think is affordable. That's the this. The you need to be able this. The point is you have tool, solution that you use to have a tool, a little, pay little. You use a a little, you pay a lot, lot. That seems fair. So, lot, you pay a lot. I think here is what I I would argue um I think here is what that's really trust it regard. One comment also made, regard. One comment you also Tommy, want to kind of maybe throw an Tommy, I want to kind idea back you. So, here's my idea, idea back to you. So, Tommy. When Fabric came out, when it Tommy. When Fabric came out, just got released, believe it was I around going GA September, I feel around going GA in September, like the end of the year, like it was the end Microsoft either had announced it or Microsoft either had announced it went with something. can't I remember exactly what happened. Um, but remember exactly what happened. Um, GA Fabric and Microsoft went GA with Fabric said, "Okay, it's okay right now. There said, "Okay, it's okay right are some bumpy are some bumpy or rough edges on it right now." I bumpy or rough edges on "Give year. said, "Give it a year. and think you'll really enjoy it." and I think you'll really What do think, Tommy? We're we're What do you think, Tommy? probably two years out now. One year out probably two years out now. definitely from when had that comment definitely from when we had

**[24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1450s)**

definitely from when we had that comment originally. What do you think? Is it is originally. What do you think? the still rough around the edges the is it still rough to you? to you? &gt;&gt; No. And I've honestly this has &gt;&gt; No. And I think really been changing probably really been changing probably seen last three six the months where you're seeing just months where you're seeing just something more ref like not just more something more ref like not refined but refined but &gt;&gt; I agree. with that statement. &gt;&gt; I agree. I agree It's the little things too, Mike. &gt;&gt; It's the little things also bugs would occur like on data flow when it came out the like on data flow when browser you're can't in the browser you're like &gt;&gt; don't know what it's doing. Yeah, I agreed. agreed. So think we're seeing now is from &gt;&gt; So I think what user interf just usability a user interf from just the point of view it's just more and more point of view it's just comfortable. But also too I'm finding comfortable. But also too I'm that am preferring more and more that I actually this perfect use case. my actually this is a perfect uh wife, she's gone back to the uh wife, she's gone back workforce they're using, you know, and like this, looking do time like this, they're looking to sheet stuff. sheet stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And responsible it. &gt;&gt; And she's responsible for I looked at what they've been, this &gt;&gt; And I looked at company's doing, and was all company's been doing, and it manual input into Excel, even though manual input into Excel, even they're time entry they're doing this time entry whole to-do. And I just looked, I'm this whole to-do. And I like, "What are you guys using to do the like, "What are you guys entry?" He's "Oh, we're using time Clockify." "Okay." Anyways, so Clockify." I'm like, "Okay." Anyways, went down bit of a rabbit went down a went down a bit of hole I'll make bit of a rabbit hole impress your boss for you and I instead impress your boss for you building semantic model, of building it in a was just like I'm just going to connect was just like I'm just this pieces API uh like and house it's my preferred way of house and it's just my really starting with data. going to really starting with &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; Yeah, never would have dreamed back in the I day I'm mindset way of Python before Power Query. Tommy, did to Python before Power Query. feel like called this one on you. I I feel like I Like were kind bit hesitant on Like you were kind of me while and was kind like you for got to really try it. Like I think it's got to really try it. you're gonna here I think you're gonna and we are. are. &gt;&gt; I'm glad saying this because I &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're saying more companies need focus their to workloads Python Spark notebooks. I workloads on Python Spark notebooks.

**[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1570s)**

workloads on Python Spark notebooks. I think that that part of the product think that that part of super solid, there. really super solid, super solid there. like product. like that part of the and that's good. So I'm very much and that's really good. So fan world um for a fan of that part fabric. one fabric. So that's one that enjoy really enjoy &gt;&gt; any so think so too when I'm and looking organizations there. Can you looking at organizations there. Can hear me? We're good. hear me? We're all good. Yeah, we're &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're good. Okay, got disconnected for a second. &gt;&gt; Okay, you got disconnected But any I'm also seeing too the the team But any I'm also seeing aspect git. not having issues aspect the git. I'm not with finding just more with git. I'm finding just preferred workflow. preferred workflow. &gt;&gt; would I'd agree with that one. Git had &gt;&gt; I would I'd agree felt really buggy the beginning, like felt really buggy in the break sometimes. have just found weird thing around git that I found one weird thing around don't love. don't really love. &gt;&gt; If you workspace with lots and &gt;&gt; If you have a of items there's lots and lots of items files, your first commit is not lots of files, your first very smooth. So that's one bit of very smooth. So that's one feedback around git. Like if you've the been building workspace has been building on a workspace just ton artifacts and the just a ton of artifacts files there's lot it's files there's a lot of large general, literally git just large in general, the check-in has limit how much stuff check-in has a limit on you can in. And so at that moment you can check in. And says I can't do it. I need a puke. it says I can't do what to be able to do on And so what you need first commit is I'm going to commit not first commit is I'm going everything. only everything. I'm going to only some things and then some things and not everything kind of slow. So Microsoft needs to do a kind of slow. So Microsoft little bit better that first commit little bit better on that large workspaces. But other than on large workspaces. But other that, Tommy, I'm with you. That that, Tommy, I'm with you. experience is awesome. really enjoy experience is awesome. I really it. it. &gt;&gt; Well, and too, I remember there you get &gt;&gt; Well, and too, I error in workspace like, the get error in the hey, can't merge these things. You we never knew why. I'm just finding the never knew why. I'm just that were not features that were things that were not features completely foreign but yet completely foreign but things that had to change our work. I think it's we had to change our the day-to-day tasks. How do you work? the day-to-day tasks. How do &gt;&gt; And find that's the things that &gt;&gt; And I find that's fundamentally shifting. So yeah, let's fundamentally shifting. So yeah, let's kind of go into the trust has definitely kind of go into the gone from we're this beta project gone from we're in this that everything's so new and just be that everything's so new and careful with point where not careful with it to a because it's the only thing just because it's the only available, available, but much so, Mike, because we're very

**[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1691s)**

but very much so, Mike, because we're finding that finding that it's better workflow. It's a better it's a better workflow. It's experience and way to use experience and it's a better data. [snorts] data. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Let Yes, would agree with that, Tommy. &gt;&gt; Let Yes, I would And think this And I think this is we are fabric has blurred the line even we are fabric has blurred more between data engineers and BI more between data engineers and analysts. It it just keeps blurring the analysts. It it just keeps more. You can give line business users so much capability with business users so much capability bringing files shaping data. I and think it's win. absolutely love think it's a win. I it. One thing I'll also observe Tommy it. One thing I'll also when fabric SQL came out I have just now when fabric SQL came out started building applications like started building applications like literally web top of literally a web application on using Azure as the fabric using Azure fabric SQL database so moving my transactional database so moving my transactional system directly into kind of system directly into fabric kind interesting I'm finding good success interesting I'm finding good success with with it &gt;&gt; usage seems fairly reasonable I can &gt;&gt; usage seems fairly reasonable still use my SQL database on a smaller still use my SQL database skew it's not too bad so I'm monitoring skew it's not too bad things doing some real testing right things I'm doing some real now of actually moving your now of actually moving your transactional system into fabric and transactional system into fabric and seeing what we get there. Really like seeing what we get there. this. One thing else I'll observe, I this. One thing else I'll really Spark team really like what the Spark doing, Tommy. This whole pay as you go doing, Tommy. This whole pay model with Spark, it's called Spark model with Spark, like it's Autoscale. Autoscale. &gt;&gt; I don't name. The name is the totally junk. Look, wrong, totally junk. Look, the name but pay as you go Spark is what it but it's pay as you really is, where link up your Spark really is, where you link environment and say, "We're going to pay environment and say, "We're going just for we're just for Spark and we're that through Azure billing." So, you for that through Azure billing." get use as much Spark as you want, as to big cluster no issue. big a cluster as you When turn on, can use the When you turn that on, engine need to, but much Spark then there's just an F2 that can run then there's just an F2 everything else. You have access to all everything else. You have access data lakehouse. Another the data in the lakehouse. pattern I'm finding really interesting, pattern I'm finding really interesting, Tommy, is do engineering in an Tommy, is do the data F2 or smaller fabric skew, lakehouses, F2 or a smaller fabric pipelines, notebooks, fun things pipelines, notebooks, all the fun that we like to to work with, and then that we like to to you import data semantic model you import the data to was pro premium per user in workspace. You want talk workspace. You want you want

**[30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1813s)**

workspace. You want you want to you talk about efficient modeling, efficient about efficient modeling, efficient costs. For 150 bucks, 160 bucks a month, costs. For 150 bucks, 160 can get F2 skew, load in a bunch you of data and make a semantic of data and you can model that is up to a hundred gigs for model that is up to 20 bucks per user. This is a great deal. 20 bucks per user. This Like the amount of that's wow, I like Like the amount of that's this lot. So, something that I this a lot. So, this really thinking here going to really am thinking here that's be more organizations need to start be more organizations need to through. Um, also Tommy, I'll thinking through. Um, also Tommy, just kind of maybe point out here. I just kind of maybe point feel like there's I'm going through this feel like there's I'm going and now where development and now where there's a pattern build it make it just work get running find that we have work get it running find value added to then come back and value added to it and optimize later bring out optimize later and then we cost tune cost then we optimize and solution I feel this makes it very easy solution I feel this makes fabric can easily get in build in fabric I can easily stuff that want come back and then optimize for use if something it doesn't work just throw it away doesn't work I can just say don't need process and say I don't need that anymore let's get rid of it that's not anymore let's get rid of useful like what we need speed to useful like that's what we take ideas into real products take ideas into real products You know, it's interesting, Mike, You know, it's interesting, Mike, because we're talking about all these because we're talking about all amazing new and advanced features, but amazing new and advanced features, that is kind of the opposite though of that is kind of the what what PowerBI was because think PowerBI's PowerBI was because I think biggest selling point even in the very biggest selling point even in beginning its simplicity. beginning was its simplicity. &gt;&gt; Five minutes to wow. It was literally a &gt;&gt; Five minutes to wow. five by five by they called five, right? &gt;&gt; they called it a get started, &gt;&gt; Five minutes to get &gt;&gt; Five minutes to get minutes to wow. Yes, I agree. So this is I think this is &gt;&gt; Yes, I agree. So an important distinction here because an important distinction here because when you about small businesses when you think about small and the things we're talking and when all the things with notebooks warehouse about with notebooks and the they Microsoft has made that I really to they Microsoft has made that me easy possible me as easy as possible &gt;&gt; jump but same time I'm looking &gt;&gt; jump in but at honestly perfect example my wife's uh at honestly perfect example my company is small design company company is a small uh you cannot expect them like they it &gt;&gt; would make sense for them to use PowerBI would make sense for them do know get that data but I to do you know

**[32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1933s)**

I to do you know to get that data but let's say I'm like hey you guys are let's say I'm like hey going spin up fabric license you're going to spin up a put things lake house and going to put things in that is lot more of you know like a that is a lot more harder terms barrier entry or harder in terms of a just ramp up time I could build for just that ramp up time my you know small company right my you know for a single report off probably one now a single report off system they're using power system that they're using using query done and it works. Yeah. query done and it works. &gt;&gt; And it's not even a demo case. I &gt;&gt; And and it's not mean, that's what we did. mean, that's what we did. Yep. &gt;&gt; Yep. But correct. &gt;&gt; But correct. If try to do that in fabric, it's &gt;&gt; If I try to like, well, you don't have access to like, well, you don't have that. can't really share the file. U that. I can't really share also using Python notebook and we're also using a Python notebook doing these things. So that is one doing all these things. So of biggest when it comes to I of the biggest things when wouldn't say as much anymore adoption, wouldn't say as much anymore but you think but the when you think flexibility product. flexibility of the product. &gt;&gt; Agree. All right. This since flexibility &gt;&gt; Agree. All right. This happening here, we're going to be is happening here, we're going flexible with this show and we're going flexible with this show and have hard transition into something to have a hard transition fun. So, uh, I'm going to Microsoft fun. So, uh, I'm going FabricCon Atlanta. Tommy, are you FabricCon in Atlanta. Tommy, are coming, too? coming, too? &gt;&gt; am try hardest because I &gt;&gt; I am going to believe you're speaking, correct? believe you're speaking, correct? Well, I'm definitely so I'll &gt;&gt; Well, I'm definitely speaking, there speaking. So, want to invite be there speaking. So, I everyone else go there. Uh, so make everyone else to go there. sure you check out um fabriccon.com, sure you go check out which is Microsoft's community. I which is Microsoft's fabric community. want push people If you want to push you people there. are not already going, I would highly are not already going, I recommend register. This recommend you go register. This be SQL conference and a fabric to all rolled into one. So, I conference all rolled into one. think it's pretty big show going I'm looking forward it.

Okay, fun little interlude. figured that &gt;&gt; so fun little interlude. was kind of honor of let's go to was kind of in fun FabCon together. I will admit though, FabCon together. I will admit Tommy, have been waking up in the Tommy, I have been waking morning and singing this song. It's morning and been singing this chorus what earworm. just the chorus is what an gets stuck head. keep gets stuck in my head. thinking, you know, mile after mile. The thinking, you know, mile after lyrics are so good. Anyways, super just fun. We'll throw out a couple uh fun fun. We'll throw out a songs here and kind of mix it up songs here and just kind bit. Um thank you all for here a bit. Um thank enjoying indulging our little fun together. If want go listen song together. If you want yourself, we have lot of other to it yourself, we have songs as well out on Spotify. Enjoy. songs as well out on This just for fun. This is for This is just for fun. community. So, um I tried to put some of community. So, um I tried these songs fabric, R out uh Reddit thread fab the R uh the PowerBI and got deleted. I'm like, PowerBI and it got deleted. "Oh, come on, guys. Live a little. Have "Oh, come on, guys. Live fun." They felt was too a little fun." They felt spammy, guess. Whatever. I &gt;&gt; Really? yeah. So, like, forget that. &gt;&gt; Really? Oh, yeah. So, I'm going put own podcast. The on world's largest We're to it out there. just going to uh put it out there. We're some news about fun get music. Anyways, all this should be fun. music. Anyways, all this should

**[38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2305s)**

music. Anyways, all this should be fun. It's in just uh hope you enjoy some of It's in just uh hope it as well. Let us know in the comments it as well. Let us what kind genre like. Maybe I'll what kind of genre you kick out couple songs in a genre that kick out a couple songs enjoy. That being said, let's get you enjoy. That being said, back to it. Tommy, let's go back into back to it. Tommy, let's your conversation around um trusting in your conversation around um trusting Microsoft Fabric. You're you're lost. I Microsoft Fabric. You're you're lost. literally now. like, I'm literally lost you now. You're done. Let's [laughter] &gt;&gt; All right. this. Let's do Okay. So, where were we, Mike? Fab this. Okay. So, where were picking up around. We're we were talking &gt;&gt; picking up around. We're about Fabcon, but kind of had gone about Fabcon, but we kind into uh working Excel's documents into uh working in Excel's using parts fabric and just talking using parts of fabric and the complexity, right? Going from about PowerBI, which was supposed to be five PowerBI, which was supposed to minutes wow, 5x5, then moving minutes to wow, 5x5, and into fabric, where have a lot of into fabric, where we have other options things build. other options and things to &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I was just kind of maybe going to point &gt;&gt; I was just kind out here, one wanted to make out here, one point I around this topic I'm really around this topic was I'm interested understanding interested in understanding if some listening the podcast, if I was some listening right? If someone else, what parts right? If I'm someone else, of fabric do you like? which parts do of fabric do you like? trust? Because don't assume you you trust? Because I don't have to all it at once and have to like like all your business or whatever you like to your business or whatever you use. You've got certain experiences with use. You've got certain experiences different parts of the product. So different parts of the product. Tommy, back you. Which are your most to solid fabric that trust? solid parts of fabric that &gt;&gt; honestly, right now it's the &gt;&gt; So honestly, right now lakehouse. I would say that is probably lakehouse. I would say that number like area where I'm the number one like area finding just, you know, source of truth. finding just, you know, source quality it. Not quality, but just the quality of it. Not doing direct lake building that way. doing direct lake building that &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Sure. Is &gt;&gt; Is so is nice. But um I always say the is so nice. But um lakehouse just kind of like that is lakehouse is just kind of now core component really what now the core component of I'm building. I'm building. &gt;&gt; Um well, I'll I'll stop there. What &gt;&gt; Um well, I'll I'll about you? And think I know what about you? And I think you're going say, but you're going to say, but No, I'm &gt;&gt; No, I'm going to it's be Spark and Python, it's going to be Spark right? So is by far my right? So Spark and Python go-to part of the solution. I love go-to part of the solution. working notebooks. There some working in notebooks. There is really neat experiences around like you really neat experiences around like have SQL databases, have SQL databases, you have warehouses the experience. Great. You can write SQL experience. Great. You can write

**[40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2425s)**

experience. Great. You can write SQL num. I just don't like how I don't like num. I just don't like the experiences work honestly. Like how the experiences work honestly. having to single I don't like having to write statement SQL statement statement SQL statement on line code editor and not be able to like line code editor and not save that statement, the output and save that statement, save the go another cell write something go to another cell and next it. The amount of time I'm I'm next to it. The amount writing multiple SQL statements side by writing multiple SQL statements side have different tables side and have different tables just scroll up down. The just scroll up and scroll notebook experience for is just notebook experience for me is top-notch. Whether you're writing TSQL, top-notch. Whether you're writing TSQL, whether Python, I whether you're writing Python, I absolutely love it. Um my only kind of absolutely love it. Um my drawback from Fabric Tommy is this whole drawback from Fabric Tommy is co-pilot experience. That's that's the one piece I feel like we're not the one piece I feel quite dialing right. And every quite dialing it in right. time see kind of show up on co-pilot top experiences, doesn't top of the experiences, it what want do. No, I &gt;&gt; it's good for asking questions. It's &gt;&gt; it's good for asking having context, little bit of good for having context, a about what's happening your context about what's happening in workspace whatever you're working in. workspace or whatever you're working So again, one the ones I use a lot is of notebooks and Python. Well, I could notebooks and Python. Well, I either fabric that charges either use the fabric one me compute units or I could go to my me compute units or I browser free that's part and of ask questions of my browser and ask around around Copilot. Hey, what does this do? How do Copilot. Hey, what does this you write function? And then I you write this function? And don't use any CU units from the don't use any CU units notebook. So whole pricing licensing notebook. So the whole pricing model of fabric co-pilot, how it gets model of fabric co-pilot, how build or build, it's kind of build or not build, it's confusing to me. Um that part I think is confusing to me. Um that just bit just a bit rough right now. And I don't I will say rough right now. And I this, definitely really trust a this, I definitely don't really lot of the things Cop's coming out with. lot of the things Cop's I'm using but verify with I'm using a lot of other tools uh see to build and other tools uh to see create things. Uh really think create things. Uh I really Microsoft needs focus their attention Microsoft needs to focus their creator experience. It's on the creator experience. It's focusing building that into their focusing on building that into agentic experiences. agentic experiences. &gt;&gt; Oh, 100%. &gt;&gt; Oh, 100%. So, that's where say I trust the the &gt;&gt; So, that's where I notebook. Tommy, I'm with you at the notebook. Tommy, I'm with you lakehouse. like it. Substantial. lakehouse. I I like it. I'll be honest, I've been really I'll be honest, Tommy, I've trusting this SQL database inside trusting this SQL database inside Fabric. Pretty awesome. Works pretty Fabric. Pretty awesome. Works pretty well. Just operates like a normal SQL well. Just operates like a database. So, that's another one I think database. So, that's another one

**[42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2545s)**

database. So, that's another one I think I would add in my pocket of my Swiss I would add in my Army knife things like around Army knife of things that fabric. That's it's nice being able fabric. That's it's it's nice to have real time transactional fast to have a real time database that's there because lakehouses database that's there because lakehouses are good but they're not really good for are good but they're not level data. They just transactional don't seem to fit that need very well. don't seem to fit that &gt;&gt; Who what type of company do you think is &gt;&gt; Who what type of the one going have the the one that is going hardest time trusting fabric? Because I hardest time trusting fabric? Because and are little different think you here because here because &gt;&gt; it's good question. What company would &gt;&gt; it's a good question. have the really stepping in hardest time trusting fabric? That's great I'm want to lean on my first reaction initial first reaction my initial reaction your comment Tommy is a is a company your comment Tommy is a that prides themselves running that prides themselves on running everything through Excel has has kind of everything through Excel has has created lot unintentional data created a lot of unintentional silos. silos. I think there's pretty big shift from I think there's a pretty working to working in Excel to working notebooks, lakehouses and tables in the notebooks, lakehouses and tables in cloud. cloud. I sizable sizable trust jump, [laughter] fall, trust jump, [laughter] trust fall, whatever you want call it, to get whatever you want to call from doing that like I I can control it from doing that like I all. It's inside my notebook. I know all. It's all inside my I'm Excel file. exactly I'm in my Excel file. what doing. That team that has built what I'm doing. That team like those macros like all those macros &gt;&gt; the file, right? Do this, inside custom that, press button, process custom that, press this button, data. Like they've all this data. Like they've spent time and rigor to go spent the time and the through process. Not saying that through that process. Not saying you couldn't rebuild same process you couldn't rebuild that same fabric. I think probably should, in fabric. I think you but there's this resistance to but I think there's this release little bit of control and put release a little bit of program you're not familiar it in a program you're with. So that would be maybe the only with. So that would be thing I say. think you know if thing I would say. I company that's doing real-time you're a company that's doing data, fabric supports it. data, fabric supports it. &gt;&gt; If is lots &gt;&gt; If you're a company of large volume, heavy volume of data, of large volume, heavy volume Fabric So that's Fabric supports it. So that's maybe where would put things. What do I you think, Tommy? No, I mean honestly, you think, Tommy? No, I Mike, it's really the whole Mike, I think it's really cloud capacity environment where that you're going to see small that you're going to see businesses, companies of like 25 businesses, the companies of like people are probably have people that are probably going

**[44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2666s)**

people that are probably going to have the hardest time just not saying they the hardest time just not won't use fabric all. won't use fabric at all. But again, I could run PowerBI on my But again, I could run local machine and think going through local machine and I think local machine and I think and the different environment going through the different environment areas of fabric is where I think people areas of fabric is where to really lose trust with it are going to really lose because now their data is not on a because now their data is device. And again, it's just harder to device. And again, it's just scale up. that's something I'm going scale up. And that's something carry with as great as fabric to carry with me is for you and who are already, you is for you and I know, kneedeep into this, a company know, kneedeep into this, a who's trying to, ramping up or who's trying to, you know, up, there's so much skill trying to ramp up, there's that that &gt;&gt; it's barely even worth the time. &gt;&gt; it's barely even worth Yeah, I want think I &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm okay with comment think I'm okay with that there. would agree little there. I would agree with bit. What other parts of fabric? So bit. What other parts of Tommy, one things you were Tommy, one of the things that talking and something that came to there mind was looking lie mind here was looking at fabric of &gt;&gt; what's happening with um not just the &gt;&gt; what's happening with um space but like real time fabric space but like the space. I really have liked a lot of space. I I really have spark and batch like the the spark and processing. So what my processing. So a lot of world is stuff. world is like batch processing Great. Super good. Then when you flip Great. Super good. Then when over to the real time, it's a over to like the real there's couple areas that I have some there's a couple areas that friction around space. friction around the real time When look other competitor products When I look at other do event driven that do real time or things, there's nowhere fabric where things, there's nowhere in fabric you can turn on a web hook anywhere, you can turn on a with basic authentication. You even can't do it. And so for me, I look at can't do it. And so this going, if I'm going to build an this going, if I'm going application like web something application like a web app or that, it's totally fine to have the like that, it's totally fine running and can secure it web app running and we because fabric has connections because fabric has secure connections into fabric. I get it. Fine. But this into fabric. I get it. whole concept of like having a truly whole concept of like having open endpoint that can use open endpoint that fabric can data userdefined functions you to them but there requires can you can use them authentication get through door authentication to get through the talk them. So that's one one of my to talk to them. So

**[46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2788s)**

to talk to them. So that's one one of my things the real-time space is things the real-time space is interesting but I don't think interesting to me but I Microsoft has fully grasp this this Microsoft has fully grasp this concept like you know for example I concept of like you know have web hook from PayPal. have like a web hook PayPal's system use doing tips PayPal's a system I use plus management people who want to for buy power designer building templates buy power designer building templates and things are using the and things or people are themes.p powerbtips site where we save themes.p powerbtips site where we your files right that kind of your theme files right that stuff. We have payment stuff. We have that we system but I can't send any of that system but I can't send web hook data to fabric without payment web hook data to first putting Azure function. first putting in a f &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I'm going my agent I'm telling So &gt;&gt; So I'm going to there's this concept of like I have to there's this concept of like still stand up Azure can do it. I still stand up like Azure make web hook that just talks to can make a web hook then filter clean my data that and then filter and directly from fab Azure. Why directly from fab from from can't I do equivalent inside fabric? can't I do the equivalent And so to me, that's something that's a And so to me, that's miss there. So feel like some of the miss there. So I feel other things around bit weak. other things around that is Um, one areas maybe it's not Um, one of the areas trust Tommy, but just high trust Tommy, but maybe it's friction for me right now. It's high friction for me right now. around service principle. friction around the service principle. When you talk about item ownership in When you talk about item fabric, everything has been built around fabric, everything has been built of individual users owning the principle of individual users items. That's okay until you have a team items. That's okay until you people trying to figure out how to of people trying to figure who owns lakehouse, created the who owns the lakehouse, who who owns the lakehouse, who lakehouse, should person have it or should a person have created service principle should a service principle or workspace identity workspace identity have created the item. item. &gt;&gt; So from one stance I'd look at this &gt;&gt; So from one stance going don't want to create anything going I don't want to me personally service the principle of workspace and principle of the workspace to own items. own the items. I want connections. So, principle to own the connections. there's two things think maybe I don't there's two things I think trust just have extra or friction. It's and that friction. It's connections and that service principal area. Like I want to service principal area. Like I be able create without people things involved, but can then edit and involved, but people can then manipulate them. That's given. It's manipulate them. That's a given. got to happen. got to happen. &gt;&gt; Let me pause there. What do you think, &gt;&gt; Let me pause there. Tommy, about that? Tommy, about that? is such good one, too, because That that's been biggest thing in that's been the the biggest terms of from connections point of terms of from the connections view. Um, and again that is something view. Um, and again that unless you know what you're doing that's unless you know what you're

**[48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2908s)**

unless you know what you're doing that's just not going to happen. So just not going to happen. &gt;&gt; is funny because fabric is &gt;&gt; you know what is it's building up but at the it's you know building us same time all those little shortcuts we same time all those little had PowerBI had in PowerBI &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yep. are and which listen this is why we &gt;&gt; are and which I have jobs for so long. I don't have had a jobs for care how big company is. you will find care how big a company lot of things under the rocks even a lot of things under with central BI team of just getting with the central BI team data like data in like you can't do that with fabric right like you can't do that with know random CSV file with you know that random that's kind of my reference table here that's kind of my reference I'm just using because I don't know that I'm just using because how to the connection or whatever the how to do the connection case may case may be &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; sure could go past &gt;&gt; that I could go and um &gt;&gt; and um with fabric it's like you have to do &gt;&gt; with fabric it's like everything right everything right you have to configured think that's I where lot of people are going to be where a lot of people left behind our systems left behind where it's like not set up way or you know that we're don't have maturity there. we're we don't have that We could export data before and get We could export the data into PowerBI worked great. into PowerBI and it worked &gt;&gt; Well &gt;&gt; Well now you know really change have our process. So want to ask you who our process. So I I do think best right now is fabric do you think best right serving and either serving and who do you individuals or companies are being left individuals or companies are being behind? behind? &gt;&gt; It's good question. I would say the &gt;&gt; It's a good question. data curious teams that are data curious teams the teams really trying to federated right when really trying to be federated you know we talked about say I adoption roadmap of Microsoft the the adoption roadmap of Microsoft talks different adoption road talks about different personas right data engineering team personas right the data engineering business analyst that's kind of the the business analyst that's like two like the two personas Microsoft identifies I think there's more than identifies I think there's more what but you know what Microsoft identifies but you let's use their example starting let's let's use their example with that with that example I think blending those two roles blending of those two roles persona there. Teams are that that persona there. Teams already doing that, teams that have already doing that, teams that leadership understands we've got to leadership that understands we've got move quickly. Data is a strategic asset move quickly. Data is a for our company need to allow for our company and we

**[50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3030s)**

for our company and we need to allow people to build what they need to build people to build what they give proper data stewardship. and give proper data stewardship. Organizations that are doing that, I Organizations that are doing that, think you're going find an immense think you're going to find amount of success with having teams work amount of success with having together build common stuff like together to build common stuff that. That is just a win. two me disciplines coming disciplines coming together to build value through data. Um, so that's value through the data. Um, what I would say the team is going to be what I would say the finding most reward or benefit from finding the most reward or using fabric. Uh, and they can trust it using fabric. Uh, and they most. Right? You're already you're the most. Right? You're already culture is there. It's the culture is already there. established. established. That was first part of your That was the first part question. Your other what question. Your other question was about teams that are going to about the teams that are struggle? Right? Seems not struggle? Right? Seems that that like this. I think there's a going to like this. I bit of skepticism for some companies bit of skepticism for some around should we be using the cloud. um around should we be using have lot on-rem things that we have a lot of we've already like there's this whole we've already like there's this you know maybe you know maybe sunk cost mentality done sunk cost mentality we've already all work it's fine all the work it's already we're not going to move forward and we're not going to move there's lot of you know cultural there's a lot of you problems around this my data I'm not problems around this is my share it be we're easily distributing information out easily distributing this information out to team that's think is the going struggle bit more in the going to struggle a bit fabric space you want to push them more fabric space you want to towards collaborative experience and towards a collaborative experience and that team can tries tries to over that team that can tries control, right? Everything has to come control, right? Everything has to from central IT. Okay, I get it. But is from central IT. Okay, I your big enough team handle all the requests, building all handle all the requests, building reports, managing things the reports, managing all the that business needs? And so I I that the business needs? And worry about teams have that super worry about teams that have central, very closed mentality without central, very closed mentality without any responsibility being given to the any responsibility being given to business. They can't handle it. They business. They can't handle it. do It's just not not capable. can't do it. It's just Because think what that does, I think Because I think what that actually prohibits you or the that actually prohibits you or company from really being uh competitive company from really being uh and happens is get a lot of and what happens is you shadow IT. You Excel shadow IT. You get shadow documents. these monolithic documents. You get these monolithic things that are built at standalone things that are built at because business needs to do because the business needs to something with their data and you're not something with their data and given tools.

**[52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3150s)**

given the tools. &gt;&gt; What do you think, Tommy? Are those in &gt;&gt; What do you think, your book or have two different your book or you have companies you're thinking of? No, companies you're thinking of? No, honestly. Honestly, for me, I'm I'm I'm &gt;&gt; going to back the small guy that's going to go back to probably have most going to probably have the difficulty, but think you we're we're difficulty, but I think you seeing right now with us where seeing right now with us it's be that selling part, going to right? So I'm central BI and right? So I think if we're looking fabric we're looking at fabric &gt;&gt; even the conversations seeing today there are so many you know places today there are so many terms of where start but in terms of where to [clears throat] it's just a few selling [clears throat] it's just a points points in terms of the questions that we're always going to the questions that we're always ask do have reorganize the entire ask do we have to team talked about this with team do we we talked managed self- service um you know like managed self- service um you how much has change how much has to change &gt;&gt; sure &gt;&gt; sure where I think for an organization like &gt;&gt; where I think for we don't can this incrementally we don't h we can and not disrupt things. um where like and not disrupt things. um you're going to see those midsize you're going to see those companies say, "Hey, have some big we projects around or projects around or you like that we're trying put into things um our olds SMS and you know our old legacy our olds SMS and you data. Let's just it in fabric and data. Let's just try it start incrementally doing that things they're already doing, right? It's not they're already doing, right? It's like especially those more middlesized like especially those more middlesized companies who have legacy u systems companies who they have legacy probably Microsoft ones. So already probably Microsoft ones. So there can be incremental gains of also there can be incremental gains learning like my last company they learning like on my last were still doing job um what were they were still doing job um called jobs and functions in SSIS. Yeah. called jobs and functions in And that was thing going on. And that was still a &gt;&gt; don't want to I don't really &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't want work anymore. I'm sorry. SSIS done with part of the I'm I'm done with that world. in something world. I want to work that's bit flexible and easier to that's a bit more flexible maintain. maintain. &gt;&gt; would completely agree with that. &gt;&gt; I would completely agree The deployment pattern of how to get &gt;&gt; The deployment pattern of SSIS stuff out the door was just SSIS stuff out the door atrocious.
