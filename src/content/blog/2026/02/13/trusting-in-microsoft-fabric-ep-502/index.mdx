## News & Announcements

### The SaaS Apocalypse Is Here

Peter's viral article on how "11 free plugins exposed tech's biggest lie" sent shockwaves through enterprise software. Anthropic's Claude Code released plugins that connect to Excel, Word, and PowerPoint—doing what many expected Microsoft to build themselves. The market reaction was brutal:

- **Thomson Reuters** — Down 18% in a single day, 33% year-to-date
- **LegalZoom** — Down 20%
- **Salesforce** — Down 26% year-to-date
- **HubSpot** — Down 39% year-to-date
- **Atlassian** — Down 35% year-to-date
- **DocuSign** — Down 52% over 12 months, 85% from all-time high

Mike's take: "These $100-200/month AI tools have changed how people work. If you're not already using AI, you're in a competitive race—and falling behind."

### AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It

- [Harvard Business Review: AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it) — This HBR article explores the counterintuitive reality that AI doesn't lighten workloads—it amplifies them. While AI handles drafting documents, summarizing information, and debugging code, workers find themselves multitasking more intensely and managing AI agents alongside their regular responsibilities. Mike confirms: "I am physically working more intensely than ever before."

### Semantic Link Now Generally Available

Semantic Link has graduated from beta to GA in Microsoft Fabric. Built largely by Michael Kowalski and the community, this tool enables data scientists to use semantic models directly in notebooks. It's become a Swiss Army knife for:

- Automating Power BI tasks against semantic models
- Translating and migrating workloads
- SQL and Spark integrations

Mike's advice: "Microsoft should focus on API-first development. Build the infrastructure, let developers create on top of it—that's where you stay relevant."

### Excel/CSV Import Deprecation

The old Excel and CSV import experience in Power BI Service is being retired:
- **May 2026** — Reports from the old experience stop refreshing
- **July 2026** — No data syncing

This is a good cleanup—we have lakehouses, OneLake, and Dataflows Gen 2 now. Time to modernize those legacy workflows.

## Main Discussion: Trusting Microsoft Fabric

After 500+ episodes talking about Power BI and two years with Fabric, do we trust it?

### The Verdict: Yes, But It Took Time

Tommy and Mike agree: Fabric has matured significantly in the last 3-6 months. The rough edges from the GA release have been smoothed out. The day-to-day experience—Git integration, notebook workflows, lakehouse operations—just works now.

**Mike's trust list:**
- ✅ Spark and Python notebooks — "By far my go-to. The notebook experience is top-notch."
- ✅ Lakehouse — Solid foundation for data engineering
- ✅ SQL Database — "Works like a normal SQL database. I'm actually building web apps on top of it."
- ✅ Pay-as-you-go Spark (Autoscale) — Flexible pricing, no limits on cluster size

**Tommy's trust list:**
- ✅ Lakehouse — "The number one area where I'm finding source of truth."
- ✅ Git integration — "The things that were buggy before just work now."
- ✅ Direct Lake — Building semantic models this way is the preferred workflow

### The Friction Points

**Copilot:** Both hosts find the in-Fabric Copilot experience lacking. "Every time I see Copilot show up, it doesn't quite do what I want." The pricing/licensing model is confusing, and they often use free browser-based AI tools instead.

**Service Principals:** Item ownership in Fabric is still built around individual users. "I want the service principal of the workspace to create and own the items—not individual users."

**Connections:** Setting up connections properly requires more expertise than the Power BI days.

**Real-time/Webhooks:** "There's nowhere in Fabric where you can turn on a webhook with basic authentication." For event-driven applications, you still need an Azure Function as middleware.

### Who Thrives with Fabric?

  frameborder="0" 
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

- **Data-curious teams** that blend data engineering and BI analysis
- **Organizations with leadership** that views data as a strategic asset
- **Teams already comfortable** with federated, collaborative approaches

### Who Struggles?

- **Small businesses** (under 25 people) — The ramp-up time and complexity may not be worth it
- **Excel-centric organizations** — There's a significant trust jump from local Excel macros to cloud-based notebooks
- **Highly centralized IT teams** — If everything must go through a single team, Fabric's self-service model creates friction

### The Bottom Line

"You can trust Fabric. There's a price point for any organization at any scale. But you have to learn it and think about how to improve your business differently."

## FabCon 2026 Announcement

Mike will be speaking at **Microsoft FabCon** in Atlanta, March 16-20, 2026. It's a combined SQL and Fabric conference—expected to be a big show. Register at [fabriccon.com](https://fabriccon.com).

And yes, Mike debuted a new AI-generated song called "Expense It" about expense reports and FabCon travel. It's on Spotify under PowerBI.tips. 🎵

[1:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=107s) And there's a little bit of um so my

[1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=110s) you'll see the particularly on this

[1:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=111s) PowerBI tips Spotify channel. It's a

[1:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=114s) little mix between like super nerdy data

[1:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=116s) lyrics all electronic dance m music

[1:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=119s) pretty much. It's all like high energy

[2:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=121s) bubbly kind of my kids call it bouncy.

[2:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=124s) It's like bouncy music. It's so bouncy.

[2:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=126s) So that's like kind of what they do.

[2:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=128s) **>>** It's bouncy is a good way to put it,

[2:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=130s) dude.

[2:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=130s) **>>** It's bouncy, right? It's kind of happy

[2:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=132s) that that energy high energy stuff. And

[2:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=134s) then I've been uh exploring what would

[2:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=136s) what it would sound like. So one thing

[2:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=137s) is I like guitar solos, Tommy. I like

[2:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=140s) rock and roll. I like heavy stuff. But I

[2:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=143s) don't like any of the lyrics on any of

[2:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=144s) this stuff. I really I literally could

[2:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=145s) just just give me like huge drums,

[2:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=148s) massive guitars, and just solo upon solo

[2:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=150s) upon solo. So I've also built another

[2:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=154s) album called Silicon Metal. Yeah. Made

[2:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=157s) by AI.

[2:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=158s) **>>** Silicon Metal. And it is all AI making

[2:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=161s) what I would call metal music without

[2:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=164s) any lyrics. So I can listen to it all

[2:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=166s) day long as much as I want and just get

[2:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=168s) that energy through the roof. Anyways,

[2:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=171s) I'm having so much fun right now. AI is

[2:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=173s) incredible. I'm having a blast. All

[2:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=175s) right, let's get into our well news

[2:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=178s) here. But before we do that, let's um go

[3:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=181s) into what our main topic will be today

[3:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=183s) is just talking about do we trust

[3:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=184s) fabric? We've been at episode 500. We've

[3:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=187s) been talking about fabric for well over

[3:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=188s) two years now. Uh how does it look? What

[3:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=191s) what does it what do we feel about it?

[3:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=193s) Uh are there any friction points? Is it

[3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=195s) getting better? What's our trust level

[3:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=196s) in fabric? How if you're a new user and

[3:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=198s) you're like I'm not quite sure about

[3:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=200s) fabric. Where do we go from here? So we

[3:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=203s) are going to definitely dive in a bit

[3:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=204s) more in this topic and talk more about

[3:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=206s) what do we find that's working for us in

[3:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=207s) fabric. Let's talk about how we trust it

[3:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=210s) or areas we're not trusting as much. So

[3:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=211s) let's we'll dive into that in a little

[3:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=213s) bit. Let's jump into some news articles.

[3:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=215s) Tommy, I got some fun ones today. I

[3:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=217s) **>>** I I do that.

[3:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=218s) **>>** Okay, so I'm going to throw down a

[3:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=220s) couple links here. One of them is al is

[3:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=222s) on Twitter and I don't even know how to

[3:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=224s) say the name of this article. Uh but

[3:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=226s) Peter, I can say his name. So Peter is

[3:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=228s) his name and Peter is talking about the

[3:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=232s) SAS apocalypse.

[3:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=234s) Sassalypse. SAS apocalypse. I don't know

[3:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=236s) how he says it in the article. It sounds

[3:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=238s) like um Anyways, I I won't get it right.

[4:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=241s) How 11 free plugins exposed tech's

[4:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=245s) biggest lie is kind of the article here.

[4:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=247s) And um I found this article to be very

[4:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=249s) interesting. Yeah. Okay. So really the

[4:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=252s) premise here is Anthropic one our our

[4:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=255s) lovely AI agent person out there.

[4:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=257s) Anthropic is building Claude Code.

[4:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=260s) That's kind of the the parent company of

[4:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=262s) what we use all the time. Tommy, you

[4:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=264s) love Cloud Code. You've seen a lot of

[4:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=265s) that. I play with it a bit. Their

[4:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=266s) models. Opus is one that I use heavily.

[4:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=269s) Um, but since the release, they released

[4:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=272s) a uh plugin basically that connects to

[4:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=277s) all of Microsoft's products. It's in

[4:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=279s) Excel, it's in Word, it's in PowerPoint.

[4:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=282s) And I think there's like an elephant in

[4:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=284s) the room here around this. People are

[4:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=286s) finding this is incredibly valuable and

[4:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=289s) wondering to themselves, why didn't

[4:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=291s) Microsoft just release this? What

[4:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=293s) happened? So there's this whole idea of

[4:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=296s) like Microsoft has this like kind of

[4:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=298s) very, you know, longstanding security

[5:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=302s) and everything that's got to move quick

[5:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=303s) with through security all these

[5:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=304s) different levels. Yeah, I agree. I

[5:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=306s) understand. But cloud code shows up,

[5:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=308s) builds a plugin, drops into your

[5:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=310s) existing tooling, and oh my word, it's

[5:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=313s) saving people tons of times all over the

[5:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=315s) place and can build things at very rapid

[5:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=318s) rates.

[5:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=320s) Let me I'll just say something here,

[5:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=322s) Tommy. This is a company that

[5:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=324s) understands the importance of creation,

[5:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=327s) the importance of working with an expert

[5:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=329s) and helping them build something. That's

[5:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=332s) where AI is really good at. It's good at

[5:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=334s) building things and doing repetitive

[5:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=336s) tasks all the time. I don't want AI to

[5:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=339s) go autogenerate me a bunch of insights

[5:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=341s) or things that I should be thinking

[5:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=343s) about. I want the AI to produce most of

[5:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=347s) content, right? Go build these files. go

[5:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=351s) build the mundane things. I want to tell

[5:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=353s) it what I want, but it should just go

[5:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=355s) build it.

[5:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=357s) **>>** You are bringing up I have a great news

[5:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=359s) article for next week. Um, I just found

[6:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=362s) it. It was all over in terms of

[6:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=365s) basically what's happening now too. And

[6:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=368s) honestly, not with the coding and I so

[6:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=371s) much more than just coding now with the

[6:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=373s) building of things. before it was like

[6:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=375s) yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah

[6:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=376s) A yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah A yeah it

[6:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=376s) could help but you're we're finding for

[6:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=378s) most developers they would have to admit

[6:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=381s) today that

[6:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=383s) AI does it better than them at a faster

[6:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=386s) rate um and I think yes so the article's

[6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=390s) name is something big is happening and

[6:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=392s) basically the idea here is if you do

[6:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=395s) remember when uh co the corona virus hit

[6:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=398s) and like the two months before it got

[6:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=402s) **>>** yeah this seems like something but I'm I

[6:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=404s) don't know, you're like, "It's not

[6:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=406s) around me." And you just kind of

[6:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=409s) thinking some people were over, you

[6:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=410s) know, like, uh, it was overblown, yada

[6:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=414s) yada yada. And that kind of phase of,

[6:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=417s) **>>** yeah, I don't think it's going to be a

[6:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=418s) big deal. And obviously, it was a big

[7:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=421s) **>>** this Yeah, go ahead. I was saying this

[7:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=423s) is going to lead this is going to lead

[7:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=424s) in very well to my next article. Keep

[7:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=426s) going, Tommy.

[7:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=426s) **>>** Okay. Yeah. And really if you've been

[7:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=429s) working in AI at all, but I think

[7:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=432s) especially thank goodness we're not just

[7:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=434s) only developers, but at all if you've

[7:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=437s) been utilizing AI, you've seen this

[7:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=440s) rapid incredible uh you know growth not

[7:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=445s) just in this ability to talk to you but

[7:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=447s) what it can do and you know that is

[7:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=450s) where things are really occurring now

[7:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=452s) where it's happening so fast

[7:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=455s) **>>** and

[7:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=455s) **>>** yes

[7:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=456s) **>>** I'll pause there. Yeah. So, in this

[7:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=457s) article, it talks about the market

[7:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=459s) reckoning. So, the fact that this $100

[7:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=461s) or $200 a month tool has been released,

[7:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=463s) Claude Code, Claude Co-work, this

[7:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=466s) tooling is now existing in the

[7:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=467s) marketplace. It took a lot of sassified

[7:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=470s) programs or companies and they took a

[7:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=472s) massive hit. Let me give you some of the

[7:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=474s) names. Thompson Vers uh went down 18% in

[7:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=478s) a single day and has been down 33% year

[8:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=481s) year to date. Legal Zoom down 20%. Um,

[8:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=485s) some of the other big ones here,

[8:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=486s) Salesforce down 26%, HubSpot down 39%

[8:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=489s) year-to- date. Alassian down 35% year-to

[8:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=492s) date. Docuine 52% down over 12 months.

[8:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=495s) 85% down from alltime high. ASA 59 60%

[8:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=499s) down over 12 months. These are crazy

[8:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=502s) numbers, Tommy. And what I think is

[8:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=504s) happening here is these tools were

[8:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=506s) around buy our seat, we'll give you a

[8:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=509s) software product that would be very

[8:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=510s) difficult for you to make. That's that's

[8:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=513s) the principle here. And so these this

[8:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=516s) cloud code and all these new AI agents

[8:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=519s) are just now entering the market. We're

[8:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=520s) just hitting again we're still in the

[8:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=521s) early waves of this. It's coming in and

[8:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=523s) it's changing how people work on things.

[8:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=526s) I saw a Super Bowl ad talking about I

[8:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=528s) don't remember what company it was, but

[8:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=529s) they're talking about building web apps

[8:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=531s) or building apps right inside their

[8:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=533s) office.

[8:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=534s) **>>** Oh yeah. Yeah. We talked about that.

[8:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=536s) **>>** This is no this is no new concept. This

[8:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=538s) has been around like power apps, power

[9:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=540s) pages have been around forever for

[9:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=541s) business users to build things with low

[9:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=542s) or no code solutions. It's just that we

[9:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=545s) just went to the uh the 11th degree.

[9:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=549s) We're we're on we're we've upshifted a

[9:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=551s) gear here and now we can do all this

[9:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=552s) stuff with AI which is incredible. So

[9:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=554s) anyways, I thought this article was

[9:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=556s) interesting. Um it basically was how do

[9:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=558s) you defend against some of these

[9:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=561s) companies that are being hit hard by AI.

[9:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=563s) I would argue if you are not already

[9:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=566s) using AI, so I think this way it's a

[9:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=568s) competitive race, right? Your company

[9:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=570s) needs people to do something. There's

[9:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=572s) you can't get rid of everyone's job at a

[9:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=574s) company because then there'd be no one

[9:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=575s) left um to do anything. And I think

[9:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=578s) that's not a good reasonable explanation

[9:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=579s) of what will happen with AI. Um there's

[9:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=582s) some experiments being made now with a

[9:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=583s) company called Macrohard where they can

[9:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=585s) build the entire company from AI agents.

[9:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=588s) Ah, I don't know. We'll see how it turns

[9:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=589s) out. Proof will be in the pudding, I

[9:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=591s) think. However, I think if you're

[9:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=594s) looking at a race here against you and

[9:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=595s) everyone else at your company,

[9:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=597s) **>>** the people that are going to hang around

[9:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=598s) the longest are the ones that are

[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=600s) understanding how to use AI and the

[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=603s) couple use cases or a couple people that

[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=604s) I've seen really adopting and bringing

[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=606s) AI to the forefront of what they're

[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=608s) doing.

[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=609s) **>>** They're building many applications.

[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=611s) They're building AI agentic like stuff

[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=614s) with their code. They're not afraid of

[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=616s) code to step in, right? They're bu

[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=618s) they're stepping into problems in the

[10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=619s) company and solving problems by building

[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=621s) solutions around them. They're problem

[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=623s) solvers. So I think for me what I'm

[10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=625s) looking at here is like look there's

[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=627s) going to be this

[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=629s) wave of AI. You better embrace it. It's

[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=633s) coming whether you like it or not. And

[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=635s) your goal should be learn how it works.

[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=638s) Figure out how to build many products,

[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=640s) applications, web apps, little things

[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=641s) that tools that help you do your job

[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=643s) better.

[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=644s) **>>** And that's one. I think it's fun to

[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=647s) create stuff like this. I just really

[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=648s) enjoy it. So, I think it's super neat.

[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=650s) But in addition to that, you got to be

[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=653s) the one at the company that is showing

[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=654s) people, building stuff, creating new

[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=656s) things, solving problems with these

[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=658s) kinds of tools. And then I think then

[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=660s) you're indestructible because why would

[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=661s) they let you go if you're building

[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=663s) things and solving problems,

[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=664s) **>>** right? Well,

[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=665s) **>>** with the AI, the thing that's coming

[11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=667s) like you have companies need AI

[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=670s) integrators. Like I'm already seeing it

[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=672s) in my business. I'm having a lot more

[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=673s) conversations around demos and things

[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=675s) and how to integrate AI into

[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=677s) applications and appdev development with

[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=679s) PowerBI.

[11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=681s) **>>** Mike, I mean, we're really just getting

[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=683s) to the point and again, I think we're

[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=685s) just going to be monitoring this more

[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=686s) and more. I I really I'm going to save

[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=688s) the article for next week, but our

[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=692s) dreams what's possible is closer to us

[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=695s) than never than ever before. But at the

[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=697s) same time, you almost feel relevant,

[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=699s) too, because

[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=701s) there's, you know, I don't want to use

[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=702s) the word disruption. I never lived in

[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=704s) Silicon Valley, but my gosh, Mike, I'm

[11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=708s) doing stuff throughout my day where

[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=711s) I would have to hire someone. I would

[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=713s) have to hire multiple people. I could

[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=715s) replace myself for it

[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=717s) **>>** like and there are things that I'm doing

[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=720s) **>>** I used to find doing like writing

[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=722s) documentation or researching I'm tending

[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=728s) **>>** and it's done better which is the crazy

[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=730s) thing. I just um you got me inspired. I

[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=733s) just created a skill for um how I write

[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=737s) my contracts and because I do it in

[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=739s) markdown.

[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=740s) **>>** Yep.

[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=740s) **>>** I'm like I wonder I know. Listen listen

[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=743s) listen. Good.

[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=744s) **>>** I'm doing the same thing exactly as you

[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=746s) speak right now. Keep going. I I love

[12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=747s) this. I'm doing the exact same thing in

[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=748s) my business as well cuz I told you

[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=750s) Tommy, write everything you can as much

[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=752s) as you can. Don't use any word docs.

[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=754s) Just write everything in Mark.

[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=755s) **>>** So, since I already have all these

[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=756s) markdown files and they have a format

[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=758s) like I wonder and I told uh Claude, I'm

[12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=761s) like, "Hey, build me a skill. Here's my

[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=764s) repo um you know, of all my uh

[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=767s) contracts." And it's pretty awesome,

[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=773s) **>>** and and also what with AI and stuff like

[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=776s) this, you can actually build yourself

[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=777s) like a a client estimator tool, right?

[13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=780s) Really fast. Hey, here is my transcript

[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=783s) from the meeting. Here's the summary

[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=785s) from cat chat JP Copilot. Here's all of

[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=789s) my historical statements of work. The

[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=792s) the bot can have access to all these

[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=794s) things. It knows and it can read through

[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=795s) everything and get context for whatever

[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=796s) it needs all right there. Boom. Read it

[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=799s) all. This is incredible. And so I think

[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=802s) if with adding so inside your markdown

[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=804s) file area, Tommy, what you should

[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=806s) probably do is you should probably have

[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=807s) a a bot go through and write down an

[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=810s) agent.mmd file and say summarize all my

[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=814s) old workers of statement. What types of

[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=816s) activities or key exercises were done?

[13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=818s) Build out a company profile based on my

[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=820s) past work. What do we do? And then when

[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=822s) you ask it to build a new statement of

[13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=824s) work, it can go there, read that first,

[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=825s) and then understand, okay, these are the

[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=827s) projects that we've done with different

[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=829s) skills. I can go look at those files and

[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=831s) get information directly from them and

[13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=833s) draw from them and put them into a new

[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=835s) statement of work. This is gamecher for

[13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=838s) me.

[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=839s) **>>** Yeah. So, um I could keep talking about

[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=842s) this.

[14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=842s) **>>** All right, let's move to the next one.

[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=844s) **>>** Yeah. So, let's there are more things to

[14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=846s) talk about surprisingly.

[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=848s) **>>** So, let's go to this other article I've

[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=849s) got here. I got another one from Harvard

[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=850s) Business Reviewed. AI doesn't reduce

[14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=852s) work, it intensifies this. I'm gonna go

[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=854s) back to this article, Tommy. We've

[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=856s) already talked about this one once

[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=857s) before. I I've read it twice now. I am

[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=860s) very convinced that this is a very true

[14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=862s) statement. Um, and this this article is

[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=864s) really good. I just want to bring it up

[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=866s) again. I feel like I'm working more

[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=868s) intensely on things than ever before.

[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=870s) I'm multitasking a bit more. I'm giving

[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=872s) agents and bots to do things on the

[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=874s) side. I I can focus my attention on

[14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=877s) something, have it the agent or bot

[14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=879s) solve it and then move on to the next

[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=880s) thing. I can't go I can't argue enough

[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=883s) for this article. It's really good. I

[14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=884s) like it. I think this is how I am

[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=886s) physically working on stuff. So, I'll

[14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=887s) just I'll leave that one there. Tommy,

[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=889s) you got some articles, too.

[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=890s) **>>** Yeah. So, I mean, if you guys have not

[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=893s) seen it, it will be in the podcast

[14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=894s) description. This is this may be a

[14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=897s) series, this article, actually, Mike.

[15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=900s) **>>** supercharge. Read the article title.

[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=901s) Let's let's hear it.

[15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=903s) **>>** Um, no, I'm saying the article that

[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=904s) you're talking about again, the AI

[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=906s) doesn't um supercharge. We may have to

[15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=908s) make a series out of that.

[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=909s) **>>** I think you're right about that.

[15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=911s) **>>** They're Anyways, we got two PowerBI and

[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=914s) fabric articles. So the first one is

[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=917s) semantic link baby is now generally

[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=920s) available in Microsoft fabric. So this

[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=924s) is something that has been available. It

[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=925s) was in beta but now it is in GA and

[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=928s) semantic link was simply created to you

[15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=931s) know um enable data scientists use

[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=934s) semantic models directly in notebooks

[15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=936s) which is something that I I've always

[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=939s) touted for. Everyone always wants the um

[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=942s) the developer experience of the raw

[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=944s) data. But why? Because you never had a

[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=946s) nice way to connect to structured data.

[15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=948s) We can automate PowerBI task in semantic

[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=950s) link uh against semantic models,

[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=952s) translate the models and even migrate

[15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=955s) workloads. There's a uh data engineering

[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=957s) operations can use semantic link for SQL

[16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=960s) and spark t tests and um semantic links

[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=964s) built by really the community and led by

[16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=966s) Michael Kovalski no Kowalsski

[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=969s) **>>** Kovalsski K

[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=972s) **>>** Michael Kovalski I'll say it go ahead

[16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=974s) **>>** yeah so they're really leaning into this

[16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=976s) even though

[16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=978s) **>>** you know it was one of their employees

[16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=980s) who really just focused on it that's

[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=982s) usually when Microsoft the most

[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=983s) successful

[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=985s) **>>** there's a difference here Tommy. So this

[16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=986s) is um you're talking about semantic link

[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=990s) **>>** which is a project. This is talking

[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=992s) about semantic link. Semantic link is

[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=994s) part of the product and semantic link

[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=996s) labs is the feeder for what features are

[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=999s) being used most that gets sent over to

[16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1002s) the actual semantic link object. So

[16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1004s) semantic link is like a a library you

[16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1006s) can just go use. This is great. I'm

[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1008s) happy this is becoming fully supported.

[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1010s) It does so many things and it's doing

[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1012s) things across not just the model side

[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1013s) Tommy. is doing things across the model,

[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1016s) the fabric API report side, like it's

[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1020s) doing so many things. It's just a really

[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1023s) good Swiss Army knife. And to be to be

[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1025s) honest, Tommy, this is what Microsoft

[17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1027s) should be working on. Microsoft should

[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1029s) be working on tooling like this,

[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1031s) building things that aid. So, a lot of

[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1034s) times we have a lot of, you know,

[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1035s) Microsoft spends a ton of time on UI, UX

[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1037s) development, user experience. Okay, you

[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1040s) get some of that stuff right. But the

[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1042s) strength of Microsoft is having an

[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1046s) rockolid API layer that lets you do

[17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1048s) anything you want to build. Let the take

[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1050s) the take the mentality of what you've

[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1053s) been doing for years, Microsoft. You've

[17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1054s) been letting people build software on

[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1056s) top of your products for years. That's

[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1058s) exactly what you should continue doing.

[17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1060s) Build the APIs, build the

[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1062s) infrastructure, build everything has to

[17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1064s) be an API first mentality. If you can do

[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1066s) that and bring things like semantic

[17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1068s) link, which are tools, all that does is

[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1071s) enable developers to build more creative

[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1073s) tools to what they need. You will stay

[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1075s) relevant longer by having all this

[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1077s) stuff. And now, Tommy, I'm using bots. I

[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1081s) have an agent here on my computer that

[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1083s) is helping me create items and artifacts

[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1086s) in fabric. Like I'm I'm actually doing

[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1088s) I've given it access. It's allowed to

[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1090s) talk to the APIs. It can make me a

[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1092s) notebook. I can say, "Hey, agent, go

[18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1095s) build me a notebook and put this process

[18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1098s) in the notebook." It writes the whole

[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1099s) thing in Python.

[18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1102s) **>>** Here's how to connect. Here's how to do

[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1103s) the transformations. All the cells are

[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1105s) written and it documents the whole thing

[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1107s) for me. So then I can go through and

[18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1109s) make tweaks to it after the fact and see

[18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1111s) what it wrote and test it. But this is

[18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1113s) incredible, Tommy. Just alone having the

[18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1116s) ability to do that is is awesome.

[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1118s) **>>** Yeah. And they they have actually really

[18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1120s) taken the official semantic links and

[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1121s) they've actually taken a lot from labs

[18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1123s) too. So it is nice to see that. It

[18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1125s) really is.

[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1126s) **>>** I love it. It's really good.

[18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1127s) **>>** All right, you got one more.

[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1128s) **>>** Finally, something sad.

[18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1131s) **>>** There's another deprecation that has

[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1133s) come our way.

[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1135s) **>>** They took away our natural Q&amp;A

[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1137s) **>>** and now we have more. Yeah. So

[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1140s) deprecation of the old Excel and CSV

[19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1143s) import experience into PowerBI. So this

[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1146s) has been around since the very beginning

[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1148s) and now it's gone. Excel and CSV files

[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1151s) are um really removing that ability to

[19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1155s) import uh into the PowerBI service. Um

[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1159s) by May of at the end of May of this year

[19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1162s) the reports that building from the old

[19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1165s) experience will stop refreshing in July.

[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1168s) Um there will be just no data that's

[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1171s) syncing. So the if you want to create a

[19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1173s) report, it's really that get data

[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1175s) experience.

[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1177s) **>>** So

[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1177s) **>>** I'm okay with this honestly. We've got

[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1180s) we've got fabric now. We've got one

[19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1182s) lake. We've got places to put files. I

[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1185s) can still use data flows gen 2 to go

[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1187s) read the file from SharePoint from

[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1189s) Lakehouse. I don't really care. I'm not

[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1191s) too worried about this one. This this

[19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1193s) one to me just feels like it's been

[19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1194s) slowly dying anyways and people are just

[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1196s) going to use it less and less. So I

[19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1199s) think this is a good deprecation. I'm

[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1200s) not I'm not too worried about it. Do you

[20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1202s) have anything, Tommy, that you have the

[20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1203s) Are you using a process today that's

[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1206s) using this feature right now,

[20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1208s) **>>** Mike? I have not touched these in so

[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1210s) long. I used to really try those once

[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1213s) like, "Oh, this is cool." But yeah,

[20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1214s) **>>** there's my point.

[20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1216s) **>>** I mean, Microsoft, they're really going

[20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1217s) through um and they've been cleaning

[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1220s) house with a lot of legacy

[20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1222s) products.

[20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1223s) **>>** That's good. Let's get rid of the stuff

[20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1224s) that you don't want to maintain. Let's

[20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1226s) get you off of those features. Let's

[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1228s) deprecate them. Get them out the door.

[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1229s) Let's focus on what we're good at. Make

[20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1231s) more APIs. Let's build better

[20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1233s) experiences. I like this. This is good.

[20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1235s) I'm okay with this one. This one This

[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1236s) one feels good to me. I feel like this

[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1237s) is a a bad deprecation in any way, but

[20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1240s) it is good to call it out. If you have

[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1241s) something you're using on it, it will no

[20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1242s) longer work.

[20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1244s) **>>** For the first time, we're seeing a lot

[20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1245s) more things being removed than I think

[20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1247s) added. And it's good. I think we're just

[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1250s) really move a different direction. So

[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1253s) **>>** I I maybe would argue Tommy like the the

[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1255s) richness of the features the or the

[20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1257s) spans of the features that fabric can

[20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1259s) provide. I think it's pretty complete.

[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1261s) You've got real time, you've got

[21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1262s) pipelines, you've got um you know all

[21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1265s) the databases that Microsoft supports

[21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1266s) and uses. They're all available. They're

[21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1267s) they're kind of in the ecosystem now

[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1270s) inside fabric. I don't think we need

[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1272s) more things. The Swiss Army knife is

[21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1275s) full. I have I have all the tools that I

[21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1276s) want. What we're doing now, I think, is

[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1278s) sharpening them, right? We're making

[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1280s) we're honing the edges. We're making it

[21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1282s) more effective. I think that's I'm

[21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1284s) liking this. I like this next stage of

[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1286s) like, okay, we we're not trying to, you

[21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1288s) know, Gartner our way into another

[21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1290s) feature. [laughter] So, there's like a

[21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1292s) term, you know, this is a Gartner

[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1293s) feature, right? This has to be a feature

[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1294s) we have for the Gartner review every

[21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1296s) year. I think we've got all the features

[21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1297s) that we need. Now, it's just refining

[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1299s) those features and making them more

[21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1300s) seamlessly integrated together. I think

[21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1302s) that's where we're starting to see

[21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1303s) things move, which is exciting. All

[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1306s) right, that being said, Tommy, let's get

[21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1307s) into our main topic. So our main topic

[21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1309s) today is trusting in Microsoft fabric.

[21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1312s) **>>** Where do you want to take this

[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1313s) conversation today? How do you want to

[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1315s) how do you want to pitch this?

[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1316s) **>>** Yeah, there's a few things as I was

[21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1318s) going through and just kind of thinking

[21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1319s) about what does it mean to trust

[22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1321s) something? And I think I took it really

[22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1323s) on the landscape of how we looked at

[22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1326s) PowerBI in the beginning. Um has our

[22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1330s) trust changed from the beginning where

[22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1331s) is something reliable? Is it something

[22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1334s) that can be used in multiple scenarios?

[22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1337s) you know, small business, enterprise,

[22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1338s) individual.

[22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1339s) **>>** Sure.

[22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1340s) **>>** Um, is it dependable? Um, in terms of

[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1343s) all the things that I needed to do and

[22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1345s) honestly, the question that I really

[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1347s) want to ask more than ever is, do we

[22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1350s) have the same um, optimistic outlook to

[22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1354s) Microsoft Fabric as we did with PowerBI

[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1356s) when it came out?

[22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1357s) **>>** Good question. So, let me let's talk

[22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1360s) about your first kind of points here,

[22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1361s) right? You said, um, where do you use

[22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1363s) it? kind of where do we where do we see

[22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1364s) it fitting inside the spectrum of

[22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1366s) things? Is it going to fit the small,

[22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1368s) medium, or large businesses? Let's start

[22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1370s) there. I'm going to say yes. I feel that

[22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1373s) I'm a small business. I pay for fabric,

[22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1376s) but I use the smaller SKUs. It's very

[22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1379s) affordable. I get a lot of value out of

[23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1381s) it. It helps me with my standard

[23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1382s) reporting, and I'm not running into any

[23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1384s) limits. Now, I do have to be careful. I

[23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1386s) can't go out and build crazy big jobs,

[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1388s) but I also am a small business. I don't

[23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1391s) have crazy tons of volume of data. It's

[23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1393s) just not required. So, I can get away

[23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1395s) with a low a lower-end skew, which I

[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1397s) think is affordable. That's the point of

[23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1398s) this. The point is you need to be able

[23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1399s) to have a tool, a solution that you use

[23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1402s) a little, you pay a little. You use a

[23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1404s) lot, you pay a lot. That seems fair. So,

[23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1407s) I think here is what I I would argue um

[23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1410s) that's really I I trust it in that

[23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1412s) regard. One comment you also made,

[23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1414s) Tommy, I want to kind of maybe throw an

[23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1415s) idea back to you. So, here's my idea,

[23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1416s) Tommy. When Fabric came out, when it

[23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1419s) just got released, I believe it was

[23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1420s) around going GA in September, I feel

[23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1423s) like it was the end of the year,

[23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1425s) Microsoft either had announced it or

[23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1427s) went GA with it or something. I can't

[23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1428s) remember exactly what happened. Um, but

[23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1430s) Microsoft went GA with Fabric and I

[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1433s) said, "Okay, it's okay right now. There

[23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1435s) are some bumpy

[23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1437s) bumpy or rough edges on it right now." I

[24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1440s) said, "Give it a year. Give it a year

[24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1442s) and I think you'll really enjoy it."

[24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1444s) What do you think, Tommy? We're we're

[24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1445s) probably two years out now. One year out

[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1448s) definitely from when we had that comment

[24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1450s) originally. What do you think? Is it is

[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1452s) the is it still rough around the edges

[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1453s) to you?

[24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1455s) **>>** No. And I think I've honestly this has

[24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1458s) really been changing probably

[24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1461s) I've seen in the last three to six

[24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1463s) months where you're seeing just

[24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1465s) something more ref like not just more

[24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1467s) refined but

[24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1468s) **>>** I agree. I agree with that statement.

[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1470s) **>>** It's the little things too, Mike.

[24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1472s) It's also like the bugs that would occur

[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1475s) like on data flow when it came out the

[24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1476s) in the browser you're like I can't

[24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1478s) **>>** I don't know what it's doing. Yeah,

[24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1480s) agreed.

[24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1481s) **>>** So I think what we're seeing now is from

[24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1483s) a user interf from just the usability

[24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1485s) point of view it's just more and more

[24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1488s) comfortable. But also too I'm finding

[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1491s) more and more that I am preferring

[24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1493s) actually this is a perfect use case. my

[24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1496s) uh wife, she's gone back to the

[24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1498s) workforce and they're using, you know,

[25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1501s) like this, they're looking to do time

[25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1502s) sheet stuff.

[25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1503s) **>>** Yeah.

[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1504s) **>>** And she's responsible for it.

[25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1507s) **>>** And I looked at what they've been, this

[25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1509s) company's been doing, and it was all

[25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1511s) manual input into Excel, even though

[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1513s) they're doing this time entry and all

[25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1514s) this whole to-do. And I just looked, I'm

[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1518s) like, "What are you guys using to do the

[25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1520s) time entry?" He's like, "Oh, we're using

[25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1521s) Clockify." I'm like, "Okay." Anyways, so

[25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1525s) went down a bit of a rabbit went down a

[25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1527s) bit of a rabbit hole like I'll make I'll

[25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1529s) impress your boss for you and I instead

[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1532s) of building it in a semantic model, I

[25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1534s) was just like I'm just going to connect

[25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1536s) this to pieces and API to a uh like

[25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1539s) house and it's just my preferred way of

[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1541s) going to really starting with data.

[25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1544s) **>>** Yeah,

[25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1545s) **>>** I never would have dreamed back in the

[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1547s) day of the way I'm the mindset of going

[25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1549s) to Python before Power Query. Tommy, did

[25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1553s) I I feel like I called this one on you.

[25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1555s) Like you were kind of a bit hesitant on

[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1556s) me for a while and I was kind like you

[25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1558s) got to really try it. Like I think it's

[25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1559s) I think you're gonna and and here we

[26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1561s) are.

[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1562s) **>>** I'm glad you're saying this because I

[26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1564s) think more companies need to focus their

[26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1566s) workloads on Python Spark notebooks. I

[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1570s) think that that part of the product

[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1572s) super solid, super solid there. I really

[26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1575s) like that part of the product. I think

[26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1577s) and that's really good. So I'm very much

[26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1579s) a fan of that part of the world um for

[26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1581s) fabric. So that's one that I really

[26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1583s) really enjoy

[26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1584s) **>>** any so and I think so too when I'm

[26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1587s) looking at organizations there. Can you

[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1589s) hear me? We're all good.

[26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1590s) **>>** Yeah, we're good.

[26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1591s) **>>** Okay, you got disconnected for a second.

[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1593s) But any I'm also seeing too the the team

[26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1597s) aspect the git. I'm not having issues

[26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1599s) with git. I'm finding just the more

[26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1602s) preferred workflow.

[26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1603s) **>>** I would I'd agree with that one. Git had

[26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1604s) felt really buggy in the beginning, like

[26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1606s) it would just break sometimes. I have

[26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1608s) found one weird thing around git that I

[26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1609s) don't really love.

[26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1610s) **>>** If you have a workspace with lots and

[26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1612s) lots and lots of items in it and there's

[26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1614s) lots of files, your first commit is not

[26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1618s) very smooth. So that's one bit of

[27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1620s) feedback around the git. Like if you've

[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1621s) been building on a workspace that has

[27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1623s) just a ton of artifacts in it and the

[27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1625s) files there's a lot of files and it's

[27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1626s) just large in general, the literally git

[27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1629s) check-in has a limit on how much stuff

[27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1631s) you can check in. And so at that moment

[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1634s) it says I can't do it. I need a puke.

[27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1636s) And so what you need to be able to do on

[27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1638s) first commit is I'm going to commit not

[27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1640s) everything. I'm going to only commit

[27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1642s) some things and not everything and then

[27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1644s) kind of slow. So Microsoft needs to do a

[27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1646s) little bit better on that first commit

[27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1647s) on large workspaces. But other than

[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1649s) that, Tommy, I'm with you. That

[27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1651s) experience is awesome. I really enjoy

[27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1652s) it.

[27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1653s) **>>** Well, and too, I remember there you get

[27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1656s) the get error in the workspace like,

[27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1658s) hey, we can't merge these things. You

[27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1659s) never knew why. I'm just finding the

[27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1661s) things that were not features that were

[27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1664s) completely foreign but things that yet

[27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1666s) we had to change our work. I think it's

[27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1668s) the day-to-day tasks. How do you work?

[27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1672s) **>>** And I find that's the things that

[27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1674s) fundamentally shifting. So yeah, let's

[27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1676s) kind of go into the trust has definitely

[27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1678s) gone from we're in this beta project

[28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1680s) that everything's so new and just be

[28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1683s) careful with it to a point where not

[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1686s) just because it's the only thing

[28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1687s) available,

[28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1688s) but very much so, Mike, because we're

[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1691s) finding that

[28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1693s) it's a better workflow. It's a better

[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1695s) experience and it's a better way to use

[28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1698s) data. [snorts]

[28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1700s) **>>** Let Yes, I would agree with that, Tommy.

[28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1702s) And I think this is

[28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1704s) we are fabric has blurred the line even

[28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1707s) more between data engineers and BI

[28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1710s) analysts. It it just keeps blurring the

[28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1712s) line more and more. You can give

[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1714s) business users so much capability with

[28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1716s) bringing in files and shaping data. I

[28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1718s) think it's a win. I I absolutely love

[28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1720s) it. One thing I'll also observe Tommy

[28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1723s) when fabric SQL came out I have just now

[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1726s) started building applications like

[28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1728s) literally a web application on top of

[28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1730s) fabric using Azure fabric SQL as the

[28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1733s) database so moving my transactional

[28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1735s) system directly into fabric kind of

[28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1739s) interesting I'm finding good success

[29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1742s) **>>** usage seems fairly reasonable I can

[29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1745s) still use my SQL database on a smaller

[29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1747s) skew it's not too bad so I'm monitoring

[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1749s) things I'm doing some real testing right

[29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1750s) now of actually moving your

[29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1752s) transactional system into fabric and

[29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1754s) seeing what we get there. Really like

[29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1756s) this. One thing else I'll observe, I

[29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1758s) really like what the Spark team is

[29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1759s) doing, Tommy. This whole pay as you go

[29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1762s) model with Spark, like it's called Spark

[29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1764s) Autoscale.

[29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1766s) **>>** I don't like the name. The name is

[29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1767s) totally junk. Look, the name is wrong,

[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1770s) but it's pay as you go Spark is what it

[29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1772s) really is, where you link up your Spark

[29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1775s) environment and say, "We're going to pay

[29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1776s) just for Spark and we're going to pay

[29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1779s) for that through Azure billing." So, you

[29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1780s) get to use as much Spark as you want, as

[29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1782s) big a cluster as you want, no issue.

[29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1784s) When you turn that on, you can use the

[29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1787s) Spark engine as much as you need to, but

[29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1788s) then there's just an F2 that can run

[29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1790s) everything else. You have access to all

[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1791s) the data in the lakehouse. Another

[29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1794s) pattern I'm finding really interesting,

[29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1795s) Tommy, is do the data engineering in an

[29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1797s) F2 or a smaller fabric skew, lakehouses,

[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1801s) pipelines, notebooks, all the fun things

[30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1803s) that we like to to work with, and then

[30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1805s) you import the data to a semantic model

[30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1808s) that was in a pro or premium per user

[30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1810s) workspace. You want you want to you talk

[30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1813s) about efficient modeling, efficient

[30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1815s) costs. For 150 bucks, 160 bucks a month,

[30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1818s) you can get an F2 skew, load in a bunch

[30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1820s) of data and you can make a semantic

[30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1822s) model that is up to a hundred gigs for

[30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1825s) 20 bucks per user. This is a great deal.

[30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1828s) Like the amount of that's wow, I like

[30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1832s) this a lot. So, this is something that I

[30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1834s) really am thinking here that's going to

[30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1836s) be more organizations need to start

[30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1837s) thinking through. Um, also Tommy, I'll

[30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1840s) just kind of maybe point out here. I

[30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1841s) feel like there's I'm going through this

[30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1842s) and now where there's a development

[30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1844s) pattern of just build it now make it

[30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1846s) work get it running find that we have

[30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1849s) value added to it and then come back and

[30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1851s) optimize later and then we bring out

[30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1853s) cost then we optimize and tune the

[30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1854s) solution I feel this makes it very easy

[30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1857s) in fabric I can easily get in build

[30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1859s) stuff that I want and then come back and

[31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1860s) optimize it for use and if something

[31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1862s) doesn't work I can just throw it away

[31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1863s) and say I don't need that process

[31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1865s) anymore let's get rid of it that's not

[31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1866s) useful like that's what we need speed to

[31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1869s) take ideas into real products

[31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1871s) You know, it's interesting, Mike,

[31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1872s) because we're talking about all these

[31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1874s) amazing new and advanced features, but

[31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1877s) that is kind of the opposite though of

[31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1881s) PowerBI was because I think PowerBI's

[31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1883s) biggest selling point even in the very

[31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1885s) beginning was its simplicity.

[31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1889s) **>>** Five minutes to wow. It was literally a

[31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1892s) **>>** they called it a five by five, right?

[31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1895s) **>>** Five minutes to get started, five

[31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1897s) minutes to wow.

[31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1898s) **>>** Yes, I agree. So this is I think this is

[31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1901s) an important distinction here because

[31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1904s) when you think about small businesses

[31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1906s) and when all the things we're talking

[31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1907s) about with notebooks and the warehouse

[31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1910s) they Microsoft has made that I really to

[31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1912s) me as easy as possible to

[31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1914s) **>>** jump in but at the same time I'm looking

[31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1918s) at honestly perfect example my wife's uh

[32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1920s) company is a small uh design company

[32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1924s) **>>** you cannot expect them like they it

[32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1927s) would make sense for them to use PowerBI

[32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1929s) I to do you know to get that data but

[32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1933s) let's say I'm like hey you guys are

[32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1935s) going to spin up a fabric license you're

[32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1937s) going to put things in a lake house and

[32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1940s) that is a lot more of you know like a

[32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1943s) harder in terms of a barrier to entry or

[32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1947s) just that ramp up time I could build for

[32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1949s) my you know for a small company right

[32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1951s) now a single report off of probably one

[32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1954s) system that they're using using power

[32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1956s) query done and it works. Yeah.

[32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1959s) **>>** And and it's not even a demo case. I

[32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1962s) mean, that's what we did.

[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1963s) **>>** Yep.

[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1963s) **>>** But correct.

[32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1964s) **>>** If I try to do that in fabric, it's

[32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1966s) like, well, you don't have access to

[32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1967s) that. I can't really share the file. U

[32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1969s) also using a Python notebook and we're

[32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1971s) doing all these things. So that is one

[32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1973s) of the biggest things when it comes to I

[32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1976s) wouldn't say as much anymore adoption,

[32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1978s) but the when you think of the

[33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1980s) flexibility of the product.

[33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1982s) **>>** Agree. All right. This since flexibility

[33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1984s) is happening here, we're going to be

[33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1985s) flexible with this show and we're going

[33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1986s) to have a hard transition into something

[33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1988s) fun. So, uh, I'm going to Microsoft

[33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1990s) FabricCon in Atlanta. Tommy, are you

[33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1993s) coming, too?

[33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1994s) **>>** I am going to try my hardest because I

[33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1996s) believe you're speaking, correct?

[33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1998s) **>>** Well, I'm definitely speaking, so I'll

[33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=1999s) be there speaking. So, I want to invite

[33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2001s) everyone else to go there. Uh, so make

[33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2003s) sure you go check out um fabriccon.com,

[33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2007s) which is Microsoft's fabric community. I

[33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2008s) want to push you people to there. If you

[33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2010s) are not already going, I would highly

[33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2011s) recommend you go register. This is going

[33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2013s) to be a SQL conference and a fabric

[33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2015s) conference all rolled into one. So, I

[33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2017s) think it's going to be a pretty big show

[33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2018s) and I'm looking forward to it. I'll see

[33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2020s) you there. It's going to be March 16th

[33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2022s) through the 20th uh in Atlanta. And in

[33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2026s) honor of that, I would love to um also

[33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2028s) throw down a song here. So, one of the

[33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2030s) things we're going to do on the show

[33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2031s) here for a little bit, just because I'm

[33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2032s) having fun with it, I hope everyone else

[33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2033s) enjoys this too. I'll give you a quick

[33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2035s) little interlude here in the middle of

[33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2036s) the show. Um, this is in honor of

[33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2039s) traveling and things as well. So, I'll

[34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2041s) throw this out here, Tommy. And, uh,

[34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2043s) we'll we'll get some music going here as

[34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2045s) well. Uh, we'll do a little intro for

[34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2047s) our music. This is called Expense It

[34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2050s) from PowerBI tips.

[34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2065s) **>>** [singing]

[34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2069s) **>>** I'm really just looking for Tommy's

[34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2070s) reaction for a lot of this song.

[34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2099s) **>>** dude. This is too much.

[35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2101s) **>>** Isn't it great?

[35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2104s) **>>** I'm having so much fun with AI. This is

[35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2106s) one of the things that that I'm doing

[35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2108s) now. Who is

[37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2250s) was kind of in fun honor of let's go to

[37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2252s) FabCon together. I will admit though,

[37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2254s) Tommy, I have been waking up in the

[37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2256s) morning and been singing this song. It's

[37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2258s) the chorus is what an earworm. It just

[37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2261s) gets stuck in my head. I I I keep

[37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2263s) thinking, you know, mile after mile. The

[37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2265s) lyrics are just so good. Anyways, super

[37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2266s) fun. We'll throw out a couple uh fun

[37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2269s) songs here and just kind of mix it up

[37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2271s) here a bit. Um thank you all for

[37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2272s) enjoying and indulging our fun little

[37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2274s) song together. If you want to go listen

[37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2275s) to it yourself, we have a lot of other

[37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2277s) songs as well out on Spotify. Enjoy.

[37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2279s) This is just for fun. This is for

[38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2280s) community. So, um I tried to put some of

[38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2283s) these fun songs out on the fabric, the R

[38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2285s) fab the R uh the Reddit thread for

[38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2288s) PowerBI and it got deleted. I'm like,

[38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2289s) "Oh, come on, guys. Live a little. Have

[38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2292s) a little fun." They felt it was too

[38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2294s) spammy, I guess. Whatever.

[38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2295s) **>>** Really? Oh, yeah. So, like, forget that.

[38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2297s) I'm going to put on my own podcast. The

[38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2299s) world's largest podcast. We're going to

[38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2300s) put it out there. We're just going to uh

[38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2302s) get some news out there about some fun

[38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2303s) music. Anyways, all this should be fun.

[38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2305s) It's in just uh hope you enjoy some of

[38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2307s) it as well. Let us know in the comments

[38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2310s) what kind of genre you like. Maybe I'll

[38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2312s) kick out a couple songs in a genre that

[38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2314s) you enjoy. That being said, let's get

[38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2316s) back to it. Tommy, let's go back into

[38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2317s) your conversation around um trusting in

[38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2320s) Microsoft Fabric. You're you're lost. I

[38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2322s) literally lost you now. You're like, I'm

[38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2323s) done. Let's [laughter]

[38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2326s) **>>** All right. Let's Let's do this. Let's do

[38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2329s) this. Okay. So, where were we, Mike? Fab

[38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2331s) **>>** picking up around. We're we were talking

[38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2333s) about Fabcon, but we kind of had gone

[38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2334s) into uh working in Excel's documents

[38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2337s) using parts of fabric and just talking

[38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2339s) about the complexity, right? Going from

[39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2340s) PowerBI, which was supposed to be five

[39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2342s) minutes to wow, 5x5, and then moving

[39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2344s) into fabric, where we have a lot of

[39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2346s) other options and things to build.

[39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2348s) **>>** Yeah. Yeah.

[39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2349s) **>>** I was just kind of maybe going to point

[39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2350s) out here, one point I wanted to make

[39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2352s) around this topic was I'm really

[39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2353s) interested in understanding

[39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2356s) if I was some listening to the podcast,

[39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2357s) right? If I'm someone else, what parts

[39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2359s) of fabric do you like? which parts do

[39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2362s) you trust? Because I don't assume you

[39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2364s) have to like like all of it at once and

[39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2366s) your business or whatever you like to

[39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2368s) use. You've got certain experiences with

[39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2370s) different parts of the product. So

[39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2371s) Tommy, back to you. Which are your most

[39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2374s) solid parts of fabric that you trust?

[39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2377s) **>>** So honestly, right now it's the

[39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2378s) lakehouse. I would say that is probably

[39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2380s) the number one like area where I'm

[39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2383s) finding just, you know, source of truth.

[39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2387s) the quality of it. Not quality, but just

[39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2391s) doing direct lake building that way.

[39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2394s) **>>** Sure.

[39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2394s) **>>** Is so

[39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2396s) is so nice. But um I always say the

[39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2398s) lakehouse is just kind of like that is

[40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2400s) now the core component of really what

[40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2402s) I'm building.

[40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2404s) **>>** Um well, I'll I'll stop there. What

[40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2407s) about you? And I think I know what

[40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2408s) you're going to say, but

[40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2410s) **>>** No, I'm going to say I'm going to say

[40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2411s) it's going to be Spark and Python,

[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2412s) right? So Spark and Python is by far my

[40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2415s) go-to part of the solution. I love

[40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2417s) working in notebooks. There is some

[40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2419s) really neat experiences around like you

[40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2420s) have SQL databases, you have SQL data

[40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2422s) warehouses or the the data warehouse

[40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2424s) experience. Great. You can write SQL

[40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2425s) num. I just don't like how I don't like

[40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2428s) how the experiences work honestly. Like

[40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2430s) I don't like having to write a single

[40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2432s) statement statement SQL statement on a

[40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2434s) line code editor and not be able to like

[40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2436s) save that statement, save the output and

[40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2438s) go to another cell and write something

[40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2439s) next to it. The amount of time I'm I'm

[40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2441s) writing multiple SQL statements side by

[40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2443s) side and have different tables and I I

[40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2445s) just scroll up and scroll down. The

[40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2446s) notebook experience for me is just

[40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2447s) top-notch. Whether you're writing TSQL,

[40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2450s) whether you're writing Python, I

[40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2451s) absolutely love it. Um my only kind of

[40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2454s) drawback from Fabric Tommy is this whole

[40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2457s) co-pilot experience. That's the that's

[40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2459s) the one piece I feel like we're not

[41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2461s) quite dialing it in right. And every

[41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2464s) time I see co-pilot kind of show up on

[41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2465s) top of the experiences, it doesn't quite

[41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2467s) do what I want it to do. No,

[41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2469s) **>>** it's good for asking questions. It's

[41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2471s) good for having context, a little bit of

[41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2472s) context about what's happening in your

[41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2474s) workspace or whatever you're working in.

[41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2476s) So again, one of the ones I use a lot is

[41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2478s) notebooks and Python. Well, I could

[41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2482s) either use the fabric one that charges

[41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2483s) me compute units or I could go to my

[41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2486s) browser and use the free one that's part

[41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2488s) of my browser and ask it my questions

[41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2491s) Copilot. Hey, what does this do? How do

[41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2494s) you write this function? And then I

[41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2495s) don't use any CU units from the

[41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2497s) notebook. So the whole pricing licensing

[41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2500s) model of fabric co-pilot, how it gets

[41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2502s) build or not build, it's kind of

[41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2504s) confusing to me. Um that part I think is

[41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2507s) just a bit

[41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2509s) rough right now. And I don't I will say

[41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2511s) this, I definitely don't really trust a

[41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2513s) lot of the things Cop's coming out with.

[41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2515s) I'm using a lot of trust but verify with

[41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2517s) other tools uh to see to build and

[41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2519s) create things. Uh I really think

[42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2521s) Microsoft needs to focus their attention

[42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2522s) on the creator experience. It's really

[42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2524s) focusing on building that into their

[42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2526s) agentic experiences.

[42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2527s) **>>** Oh, 100%.

[42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2529s) **>>** So, that's where I say I trust the the

[42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2531s) notebook. Tommy, I'm with you at the

[42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2532s) lakehouse. I I like it. Substantial.

[42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2534s) I'll be honest, Tommy, I've been really

[42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2536s) trusting this SQL database inside

[42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2538s) Fabric. Pretty awesome. Works pretty

[42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2541s) well. Just operates like a normal SQL

[42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2543s) database. So, that's another one I think

[42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2545s) I would add in my pocket of my Swiss

[42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2546s) Army knife of things that I like around

[42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2548s) fabric. That's it's it's nice being able

[42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2549s) to have a real time transactional fast

[42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2552s) database that's there because lakehouses

[42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2554s) are good but they're not really good for

[42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2556s) transactional level data. They just

[42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2557s) don't seem to fit that need very well.

[42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2559s) **>>** Who what type of company do you think is

[42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2562s) the one that is going to have the

[42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2564s) hardest time trusting fabric? Because I

[42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2567s) think you and I are a little different

[42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2568s) here because

[42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2569s) **>>** it's a good question. What company would

[42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2572s) have the hardest time really stepping in

[42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2574s) and trusting fabric?

[42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2579s) That's a great I'm I want to lean on my

[43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2581s) first reaction my initial reaction to

[43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2582s) your comment Tommy is a is a company

[43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2585s) that prides themselves on running

[43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2587s) everything through Excel has has kind of

[43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2590s) created a lot of unintentional data

[43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2592s) silos.

[43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2594s) I think there's a pretty big shift from

[43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2596s) working in Excel to working in

[43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2598s) notebooks, lakehouses and tables in the

[43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2601s) cloud. I I I I think there's a pretty

[43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2607s) trust jump, [laughter] trust fall,

[43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2610s) whatever you want to call it, to get

[43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2611s) from doing that like I I can control it

[43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2613s) all. It's all inside my notebook. I know

[43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2615s) I'm in my Excel file. I know exactly

[43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2616s) what I'm doing. That team that has built

[43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2618s) like all those macros

[43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2620s) **>>** inside the Excel file, right? Do this,

[43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2622s) custom that, press this button, process

[43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2624s) all this data. Like they've they've

[43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2626s) spent the time and the rigor to go

[43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2627s) through that process. Not saying that

[43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2629s) you couldn't rebuild that same process

[43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2630s) in fabric. I think you probably should,

[43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2633s) but I think there's this resistance to

[43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2635s) release a little bit of control and put

[43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2636s) it in a program you're not as familiar

[43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2638s) with. So that would be maybe the only

[43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2639s) thing I would say. I think you know if

[44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2641s) you're a company that's doing real-time

[44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2642s) data, fabric supports it.

[44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2644s) **>>** If you're a company that is doing lots

[44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2646s) of large volume, heavy volume of data,

[44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2649s) Fabric supports it. So that's that's

[44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2651s) maybe where I would put things. What do

[44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2652s) you think, Tommy? No, I mean honestly,

[44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2654s) Mike, I think it's really the whole

[44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2656s) cloud capacity environment where I think

[44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2660s) that you're going to see small

[44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2661s) businesses, the companies of like 25

[44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2664s) people that are probably going to have

[44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2666s) the hardest time just not saying they

[44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2669s) won't use fabric at all.

[44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2673s) But again, I could run PowerBI on my

[44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2676s) local machine and I think going through

[44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2682s) going through the different environment

[44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2683s) areas of fabric is where I think people

[44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2685s) are going to really lose trust with it

[44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2687s) because now their data is not on a

[44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2689s) device. And again, it's just harder to

[44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2691s) scale up. And that's something I'm going

[44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2693s) to carry with me is as great as fabric

[44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2697s) is for you and I who are already, you

[45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2700s) know, kneedeep into this, a company

[45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2702s) who's trying to, you know, ramping up or

[45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2704s) trying to ramp up, there's so much skill

[45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2707s) **>>** it's barely even worth the time.

[45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2710s) **>>** Yeah, I I I want to Yeah, I think I

[45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2713s) think I'm okay with that that comment

[45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2714s) there. I would agree with that a little

[45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2715s) bit. What other parts of fabric? So

[45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2719s) Tommy, one of the things that you were

[45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2720s) talking there and something that came to

[45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2721s) mind here was looking at fabric in lie

[45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2724s) **>>** what's happening with um not just the

[45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2727s) fabric space but like the real time

[45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2728s) space. I I really have liked a lot of

[45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2731s) like the the spark and the batch

[45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2733s) processing. So a lot of what a lot of my

[45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2734s) world is like batch processing stuff.

[45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2736s) Great. Super good. Then when you flip

[45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2740s) over to like the real time, it's a

[45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2742s) there's a couple areas that I have some

[45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2744s) friction around the real time space.

[45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2746s) When I look at other competitor products

[45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2748s) that do real time or event driven

[45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2750s) things, there's nowhere in fabric where

[45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2753s) you can turn on a web hook anywhere,

[45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2756s) even with basic authentication. You

[45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2758s) can't do it. And so for me, I look at

[46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2760s) this going, if I'm going to build an

[46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2761s) application like a web app or something

[46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2763s) like that, it's totally fine to have the

[46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2765s) web app running and we can secure it

[46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2767s) because fabric has secure connections

[46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2769s) into fabric. I get it. Fine. But this

[46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2771s) whole concept of like having a truly

[46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2773s) open endpoint that fabric can use

[46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2778s) to get data in userdefined functions you

[46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2782s) can you can use them but there requires

[46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2784s) authentication to get through the door

[46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2785s) to talk to them. So that's one one of my

[46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2788s) things the real-time space is

[46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2789s) interesting to me but I don't think

[46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2791s) Microsoft has fully grasp this this

[46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2793s) concept of like you know for example I

[46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2795s) have like a web hook from PayPal.

[46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2797s) PayPal's a system I use for doing tips

[46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2799s) plus management for people who want to

[46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2800s) buy power designer building templates

[46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2802s) and things or people are using the

[46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2804s) themes.p powerbtips site where we save

[46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2805s) your theme files right that kind of

[46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2807s) stuff. We have that we have a payment

[46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2809s) system but I can't send any of that

[46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2811s) payment web hook data to fabric without

[46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2813s) first putting in a f a Azure function.

[46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2816s) **>>** Yeah.

[46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2817s) **>>** So I'm going to my agent I'm telling So

[46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2819s) there's this concept of like I have to

[47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2821s) still stand up like Azure can do it. I

[47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2823s) can make a web hook that just talks to

[47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2825s) that and then filter and clean my data

[47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2827s) directly from fab from from Azure. Why

[47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2829s) can't I do the equivalent inside fabric?

[47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2831s) And so to me, that's something that's a

[47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2832s) miss there. So I feel like some of the

[47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2834s) other things around that is a bit weak.

[47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2837s) Um, one of the areas that maybe it's not

[47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2839s) trust Tommy, but maybe it's just high

[47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2840s) friction for me right now. It's high

[47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2842s) friction around the service principle.

[47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2844s) When you talk about item ownership in

[47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2846s) fabric, everything has been built around

[47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2848s) the principle of individual users owning

[47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2851s) items. That's okay until you have a team

[47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2855s) of people trying to figure out how to

[47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2856s) who owns the lakehouse, who created the

[47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2861s) should a person have created it or

[47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2863s) should a service principle or the

[47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2866s) workspace identity have created the

[47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2868s) item.

[47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2869s) **>>** So from one stance I'd look at this

[47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2871s) going I don't want to create anything

[47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2874s) me personally I want the service

[47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2876s) principle of the workspace to create and

[47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2879s) own the items. I want the service

[48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2880s) principle to own the connections. So,

[48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2882s) there's two things I think maybe I don't

[48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2884s) trust or maybe I just have extra

[48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2885s) friction. It's connections and that

[48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2887s) service principal area. Like I want to

[48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2888s) be able to create things without people

[48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2890s) involved, but people can then edit and

[48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2892s) manipulate them. That's a given. It's

[48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2893s) got to happen.

[48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2895s) **>>** Let me pause there. What do you think,

[48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2896s) Tommy, about that?

[48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2897s) **>>** That is such a good one, too, because

[48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2900s) that's been the the biggest thing in

[48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2901s) terms of from the connections point of

[48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2903s) view. Um, and again that is something

[48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2906s) unless you know what you're doing that's

[48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2908s) just not going to happen. So

[48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2912s) **>>** you know what is funny because fabric is

[48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2914s) it's you know building us up but at the

[48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2917s) same time all those little shortcuts we

[48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2919s) had in PowerBI

[48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2920s) **>>** Yep.

[48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2921s) **>>** are and which I listen this is why we

[48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2924s) have had a jobs for so long. I don't

[48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2926s) care how big a company is. you will find

[48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2929s) a lot of things under the rocks even

[48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2931s) with the central BI team of just getting

[48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2933s) data in like

[48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2936s) you can't do that with fabric right like

[48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2938s) with you know that random CSV file

[49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2941s) that's kind of my reference table here

[49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2943s) that I'm just using because I don't know

[49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2945s) how to do the connection or whatever the

[49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2946s) case may be

[49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2947s) **>>** sure

[49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2947s) **>>** that I could go past

[49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2949s) **>>** and um

[49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2952s) **>>** with fabric it's like you have to do

[49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2954s) everything right you have to have it

[49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2955s) configured right and I think that's

[49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2957s) where a lot of people are going to be

[49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2958s) left behind where it's like our systems

[49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2961s) are not set up that way or you know

[49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2963s) we're we don't have that maturity there.

[49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2966s) We could export the data before and get

[49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2968s) into PowerBI and it worked great.

[49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2973s) **>>** Well

[49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2975s) now we have to you know really change

[49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2976s) our process. So I I want to ask you who

[49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2979s) do you think best right now is fabric

[49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2981s) serving and who do you think either

[49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2984s) individuals or companies are being left

[49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2986s) behind?

[49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2987s) **>>** It's a good question. I would say the

[49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2990s) data curious teams the teams that are

[49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2993s) really trying to be federated right when

[49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2996s) I say federated you know we talked about

[49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=2997s) the adoption roadmap of Microsoft the

[50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3000s) adoption road talks about different

[50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3001s) personas right the data engineering team

[50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3003s) the the business analyst that's kind of

[50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3005s) like the two personas Microsoft

[50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3006s) identifies I think there's more than

[50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3008s) what Microsoft identifies but you know

[50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3009s) let's let's use their example starting

[50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3012s) with that example I think the that

[50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3015s) blending of those two roles

[50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3018s) that that persona there. Teams that are

[50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3020s) already doing that, teams that have

[50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3022s) leadership that understands we've got to

[50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3024s) move quickly. Data is a strategic asset

[50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3027s) for our company and we need to allow

[50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3030s) people to build what they need to build

[50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3031s) and give proper data stewardship.

[50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3035s) Organizations that are doing that, I

[50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3037s) think you're going to find an immense

[50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3038s) amount of success with having teams work

[50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3041s) together to build common stuff like

[50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3043s) that. That to me is just a win. two

[50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3046s) disciplines coming together to build

[50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3048s) value through the data. Um, so that's

[50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3050s) what I would say the team is going to be

[50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3052s) finding the most reward or benefit from

[50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3054s) using fabric. Uh, and they can trust it

[50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3056s) the most. Right? You're already you're

[50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3058s) the culture is already there. It's

[50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3059s) established.

[51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3061s) That was the first part of your

[51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3062s) question. Your other question was what

[51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3064s) about the teams that are going to

[51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3065s) struggle? Right? Seems that that are not

[51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3067s) going to like this. I think there's a

[51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3068s) bit of skepticism for some companies

[51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3071s) around should we be using the cloud. um

[51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3073s) we have a lot of on-rem things that

[51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3075s) we've already like there's this whole

[51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3077s) you know maybe

[51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3080s) sunk cost mentality we've already done

[51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3083s) all the work it's already here it's fine

[51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3084s) we're not going to move forward and

[51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3086s) there's a lot of you know cultural

[51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3088s) problems around this is my data I'm not

[51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3091s) going to share it we're not going to be

[51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3092s) easily distributing this information out

[51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3093s) to the team that's a team I think is

[51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3095s) going to struggle a bit more in the

[51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3097s) fabric space you want to push them more

[51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3099s) towards a collaborative experience and

[51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3101s) that team that can tries tries to over

[51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3103s) control, right? Everything has to come

[51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3105s) from central IT. Okay, I get it. But is

[51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3109s) your central IT team big enough to

[51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3110s) handle all the requests, building all

[51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3113s) the reports, managing all the things

[51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3116s) that the business needs? And so I I

[52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3120s) worry about teams that have that super

[52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3122s) central, very closed mentality without

[52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3126s) any responsibility being given to the

[52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3128s) business. They can't handle it. They

[52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3129s) can't do it. It's just not not capable.

[52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3131s) Because I think what that does, I think

[52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3133s) that actually prohibits you or the

[52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3136s) company from really being uh competitive

[52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3140s) and what happens is you get a lot of

[52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3142s) shadow IT. You get shadow Excel

[52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3144s) documents. You get these monolithic

[52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3145s) things that are built at standalone

[52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3147s) because the business needs to do

[52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3148s) something with their data and you're not

[52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3150s) given the tools.

[52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3151s) **>>** What do you think, Tommy? Are those in

[52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3153s) your book or you have two different

[52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3154s) companies you're thinking of? No,

[52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3156s) **>>** honestly. Honestly, for me, I'm I'm I'm

[52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3159s) going to go back to the small guy that's

[52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3162s) going to probably have the most

[52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3162s) difficulty, but I think you we're we're

[52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3165s) seeing right now with us where

[52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3168s) it's going to be that selling part,

[52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3170s) right? So I think if I'm central BI and

[52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3173s) we're looking at fabric

[52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3175s) **>>** and even we're seeing the conversations

[52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3177s) today there are so many you know places

[53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3180s) in terms of where to start but

[53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3183s) [clears throat] it's just a few selling

[53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3184s) points in terms of

[53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3187s) the questions that we're always going to

[53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3188s) ask do we have to reorganize the entire

[53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3191s) team do we we talked about this with

[53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3192s) managed self- service um you know like

[53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3195s) how much has to change

[53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3197s) **>>** sure

[53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3197s) **>>** where I think for an organization like

[53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3200s) we don't h we can do this incrementally

[53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3201s) and not disrupt things. um where like

[53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3205s) you're going to see those midsize

[53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3206s) companies to say, "Hey, we have some big

[53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3210s) projects around or you like we have

[53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3212s) things that we're trying to um put into

[53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3214s) our olds SMS and you know our old legacy

[53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3218s) data. Let's just try it in fabric and

[53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3220s) start incrementally doing things that

[53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3221s) they're already doing, right? It's not

[53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3224s) like especially those more middlesized

[53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3226s) companies who they have legacy u systems

[53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3230s) already probably Microsoft ones. So

[53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3232s) there can be incremental gains of also

[53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3235s) learning like on my last company they

[53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3238s) were still doing job um what were they

[54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3241s) called jobs and functions in SSIS. Yeah.

[54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3244s) And that was still a thing going on.

[54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3246s) **>>** Yeah. I don't want to I don't really

[54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3247s) want to work in SSIS anymore. I'm sorry.

[54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3249s) I'm I'm done with that part of the

[54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3250s) world. I want to work in something

[54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3252s) that's a bit more flexible and easier to

[54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3254s) maintain.

[54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3255s) **>>** I would completely agree with that.

[54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3257s) **>>** The deployment pattern of how to get

[54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3258s) SSIS stuff out the door was just

[54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3260s) atrocious. And I all the I'm done. If I

[54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3264s) had to work in Visual Studio, not just

[54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3267s) Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio Code,

[54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3268s) I like Visual Studio, I'm done. I don't

[54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3272s) it's too the program is too bloated. I

[54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3273s) don't need any of that. Like nowadays,

[54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3276s) if I can't if I can't build it in visual

[54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3278s) studio code, any kind of app or

[54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3280s) software, I like I don't want to I don't

[54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3281s) want to mess with it,

[54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3282s) **>>** dude. A thousand%.

[54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3283s) **>>** Not for me.

[54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3285s) But but again this is something that is

[54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3287s) occurring in more than uh still

[54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3292s) **>>** but I think it's getting I think it's

[54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3293s) getting diminished. I think it's

[54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3295s) shrinking. I feel like that size of the

[54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3296s) world is getting smaller and smaller and

[54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3298s) maybe it's just the people that I engage

[54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3299s) or attract or the companies that I'm

[55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3300s) talking to. It's more we're in the

[55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3303s) cloud. We've got servers in the cloud.

[55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3304s) We're doing migrations. We're we're

[55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3306s) becoming more efficient. We're doubling

[55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3309s) down on fabric is our business

[55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3312s) management tool tool. We're going to

[55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3313s) stay there and work on things.

[55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3316s) **>>** Yeah.

[55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3316s) **>>** All right, Tommy, we're just about at

[55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3317s) time here. We're right here at the end.

[55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3319s) I want to This is a good conversation. I

[55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3321s) like the articles we brought up today. I

[55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3322s) think this is good. My thesis here is

[55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3325s) you can trust fabric. You can you you

[55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3328s) can do it. Um, jump in. There's a price

[55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3330s) point for any organization at any scale,

[55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3332s) any size.

[55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3334s) But you got to learn it. You do have to

[55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3336s) take some time to do and think about how

[55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3338s) you can improve your business by

[55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3339s) thinking about your business differently

[55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3341s) and leveraging fabric to help with that.

[55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3343s) That being said, Tommy, where else can

[55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3344s) you find the podcast?

[56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3373s) uh we did a test today of throwing out

[56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3376s) some music that we've been producing for

[56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3378s) just fun things around data. Did you

[56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3380s) like it? Did you not like it? Let us

[56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90svovLaJPM&t=3388s) It probably won't be every episode, but
