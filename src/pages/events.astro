      Welcome to the Milwaukee Brew City Fabric Meetup, where we bond over our love of all things fabric-related!
      Whether you're an experienced quilter (pipelines), a newbie crafter (Analyst), or just someone who loves data,
      this group is for you. Join us to share tips, tricks, and ideas for working with Microsoft fabric, as well as
      attend local user group meetings. Let's stitch together a community of like-minded individuals who are
      passionate about Data, Fabric, and Business Intelligence. So grab your Excel Sheets, SQL Servers, and
      creativity, and let's become a Fabricator!
