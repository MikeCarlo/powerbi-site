    <h4>The Passion is Real</h4>
    <p>
      One thing I can guarantee you is that the Delta team has passion. They really LOVE talking about data. And, that
      might even be an understatement. Their passion for finding truth in data really impacted me. This was evident
      while I was attending there Delta Business Insights Black Belt Level 1 Course. Needless to say training was
      challenging and fun.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Love Delta</h2>
    <p>
      Nowadays, merely thinking with an analytical mind is not enough. With all the choices of visualization tools, we
      need to communicate clearly and effectively. This is the beauty of the Delta Associates training programs. Each
      course is designed to provide you with technical know how but also teaches you to communicate with data.
    </p>

    <h4>My Story</h4>
    <p>
      Here is my personal story. Let’s go back to when I was working for Johnson Controls. At the time I was on the
      Business Intelligence and Analytics team. I had clearly shown my knack for working with Excel. I’d become that go
      to guy to fix all the Excel issues. My background in Mechanical Engineering was foundational in needing to use
      excel to chew through data. I quickly became good at writing macros, complex formulas.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Delta team was hired to train our Category Management team. We were taught how to critically weed through
      massive amounts of data to find the most impactful insights. I attended the
      <a href="https://delta-assoc.com/course-schedules/business-insights-bb-option-1/?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=cc&utm_content=powerbitips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insights: Black Belt Level 1 Certification</a>.
      I Felt like this would be a breeze since I already knew a ton about Excel. However, the training went way beyond
      just clicking the buttons in Excel. I was challenged to review the data more intently. We worked through how to
      measure performance, and communicate with our data.
    </p>

    <p>
      For me this was a turning point in my career. I decided that Data and Analytics is for me. That was about the
      time that I started to dive heavily into Excel Power Query and Power BI. From there the rest was history. Data is
      now my life. I love working with other individuals who love and value the importance to data.
